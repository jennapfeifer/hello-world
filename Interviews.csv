INT: Did you have any questions about the project or the work before starting?
R: No, nothing.
INT: Great. We’ll get straight to it. There are a couple of questions to begin around the general background. So, to start, can you please give a brief overview of your role and the organisation you work for?
00:28
R: My role, I’m [job title] in Wales. I’ve been in this role for about a year but I’ve been working for the [name of organisation] for about ten years. The [name of organisation]... We have services across the whole of Wales – services commissioned mostly by health boards. But my work and the work of my team is to engage with groups. We work with volunteers, work on projects and activities in the community. Then the services I was talking about usually run for a year. And what we’ve seen over the years is once that year has ended, there’s nothing. And that’s what we’re trying to prevent or work with stroke survivors and carers now to ensure they’re not left after a year. A stroke is something that... Well, the effects of a stroke can last for ever – whilst the individual is alive, that is. So we work with them to try and bring them back to activities, try to rebuild their confidence, and work again to reduce loneliness, especially in the past two years. It was quite bad before, but the past two years have been exceptionally hard. So that’s what we do. We also carry out research work as an association, work with volunteers, provide information, and raise awareness of stroke and the risk factors of stroke in the community.
02:32
INT: Great. Thank you for that information. Can you talk about the work you do with older people specifically, if that’s a specific group you work with, and in terms of that, how much focus is there on preventing loneliness?
R: Most people who have a stroke are over 65, so they would be older people. It depends exactly what your definition is of an older person. Someone 50 years old can be an older person, or 65 or whatever. Most the people we work with are older people. What we do is we work with them, either one-to-one or in a group, and try to pair them up with volunteers working on... Well, try to bring them out of themselves, try to get them back to activities they either did before they had a stroke or sometimes start new activities. We also work with an umbrella group of partners in the community. An example of this would be golf [name of organisation]. We’ve also ran therapy projects – some art therapy. We’ve... so many things. Fishing... It depends what the individual’s interests are. We try to work with individuals and pair them up with other stroke survivors with the same kind of interests. This has worked very successfully. We have a project at the moment [name of project] is the name of the project, until the end of this March. What this project has been doing is focusing on, and zooming in, really, on the requirements of stroke survivors across Wales. And, as I said, using volunteers and asking the stroke survivors to... I don’t know... Sorry, the train of thought has gone completely.
INT: No problem.
05:01
R: With groups as well, so that they... well, engage with groups, join groups, and then from those groups they can develop some small companionship groups within groups and things go on from there then.
05:21
INT: It sounds like very valuable work which you do. Thanks for that background. The next questions focus more on the role of technology. So first if you go back to the early days of the Coronavirus pandemic, what kind of conversations took place in your organisation with regards how digital technology could or should be used in terms of preventing or alleviating loneliness?
R: Right at the start of the pandemic, we had to... Well, we met up quickly as a team within Wales and went about working with a fair number of stroke survivors by asking them... Before the pandemic, everything was face-to-face. The groups were face-to-face, every activity, every project we had was face-to-face. The conversations we had were, looking ahead... We of course didn’t know how long this pandemic would last. But looking ahead, how about starting to use technology and meeting up by using Zoom and Teams and Facetime and so on in order to try and carry on some activities or start new activities so as to ensure people didn’t feel lonely, and try, as they say in English, to plug the gap, in activities. So before the pandemic, of course, we had activities face-to-face. As a team, we came together very quickly. We bought a Zoom licence. Well, four Zoom licences to tell the truth so the four officers we had across Wales were able to contact with the stroke survivors they worked with and offer activities. We also had funding from the [name of fund] to develop activities online and that’s what we did. And we had a fair number of activities we were able to offer, from Spanish lessons to Welsh lessons, to Welsh groups we established, and therapy once again online, mindfulness courses. There were so many activities we ran. We then looked back. We did work with the stroke survivors and then asked them what effect that kind of activity had to them. And the... Well, what they had to say was so positive. It’s made an exceptional difference to them. It’s helped them not feel so lonely.
08:22
R: Other things like... The problem we had before was we could run activities in areas and that meant it could be very good for those areas. But there were stroke survivors missing out because there weren’t enough for us to start a group or whatever. By doing everything online, that’s... The... The boundaries have gone now. They can join with people, like someone from [name of city] can meet up with someone from [name of city], and these groups are groups that are still going ahead now. So that’s been exceptionally positive. We also have, what we’ve seen is the same stroke survivors attend several different groups – on different days, that is. And that’s really helped them to not feel the loneliness and too isolated.
09:27
Carers as well. There are people as well, with carers, the whole focus has been on them caring for individuals and we’re also welcoming carers to the groups for them to be supported as well, that is.
And thinking ahead, as I said, the project ends in March. We’ve gone back to the Lottery and asked for more money and the model we’re working towards now is what we call the blended approach. So there will be some amount of face-to-face, but of course continuing with the online sessions as well because they’re so valuable and we don’t want to lose them.
10:13
INT: It’s great it’s such a positive experience. That’s great. I’ll come back in terms of looking to the future. But to ask a bit more about what you’ve already said. You said there were many advantages of using technology in terms of alleviating loneliness. Were there any disadvantages you and your colleagues...?
R: At the very start, what we saw as a heck of a disadvantage was not everyone could or wanted to join online. There’s a lot of older people who haven’t used technology in the past. What we did is we worked with [name of organisation] and [name of organisation] put on courses on our behalf for stroke survivors and their carers, that is, so as to try to get them online, which has worked very well. Not for everyone, but on the whole, it’s worked very well.
11:24
R: Another matter we had was poor signal, especially in the more rural places. That has been a heck of a challenge for us. Also, what we realised was not everyone had the devices to go online. So we had a grant programme and we extended that grant programme to buy laptops, iPads, wi-fi even – to pay for wi-fi or broadband for stroke survivors to help them be able to join us online. That was at the very start. As I said, it hasn’t worked for everyone, but it has worked for the majority. Also with the nature of stroke – stroke can effect communication and this has been an exceptionally big challenge for us – trying to ensure that they weren’t left behind because of all the difficulties they had and because they had nobody to support them either. But I’d say those are the biggest problems or challenges we had.
12:43
INT: Yes, it makes sense by discussing access problems and the such. Were they things that you already had evidence would be the challenges or was it new to you in terms of... because of the pandemic?
R: Completely new, to be honest. We did as a team have conversations before the pandemic about online sessions, and, well, ‘no’ was the response. Nobody was interested in online sessions. Everyone appreciated face-to-face meetings. Nobody thought it would work, in terms of the stroke survivors, that is.
13:25
But, of course, with the pandemic, there was no choice. And it’s done us a great favour as an institution. We’ve been able to move forward. Without the pandemic, I don’t think we’d even be thinking about doing anything online. So in that sense, in a funny way, it has done us a favour. But of course, we had no experience before the pandemic. It wasn’t a conversation we’d had, about challenges.
13:57
INT: It sounds like you responded in a comprehensive way, to be fair, in terms of all the challenges. You’ve talked already about what went online, but can you share more details about the main ways you used digital technology to alleviate loneliness during the pandemic?
14:18
R: The main ways were... Well, everything went either on Zoom, Teams, Facetime. We got rid of Skype quite early. We didn’t see Skype working that well for us. Then, as I said, we ran sessions. We also did one-to-one assessments online. Well, we did start by making phone calls, but it’s very difficult to get all the information we need when we do the assessments of individuals on the phone. We need to see them, to see how they’re coping. You can read the face as well, by seeing someone. It’s not as good as face-to-face, but that’s the closest thing we had. Then we changed a lot of the ways we worked to the sessions online and the assessments online as well during the pandemic.
INT: Thank you that for.
15:32
INT: Generally, do you think you succeeded in your aim in terms of using technology to alleviate loneliness?
R: Yes, I do. As I said before, after having had conversations with stroke survivors and carers, what’s been fed back to us has been exceptionally positive. We did have the aim of alleviating loneliness, and I do think we’ve succeeded to do that. As I said, it hasn’t been for everyone, and that’s very unfortunate. But for the ones we have worked with, they’ve started, as I said, their own new friendship groups. The individuals are part of more than one group, more than one session. It’s been a very good way for us to stay in touch as well. Before, of course, everything was face-to-face and there was travelling, and that took time. By doing things online, we can press a button and that’s it, we’re there. So, what we saw as well is we could see more people, talk with more people, engage with more people than we could before. So, I think that also has helped. And the information fed back has all been positive, to be honest.
17:09
INT: Great. That’s nice to hear. Do you think you were more or less successful alleviating loneliness with some groups of people than with others?
R: Yes, we were. Going back to people who’s communication and speech had been affected by a stroke... This is a daily topic of discussion with us in the organization. And... Well... I don’t know how much more we could have done, to be honest. We are also, at the moment, looking into different communities. For example, hard to reach or harder to reach communities. Most of our sessions have been for people who either speak Welsh or who speak English. We, even now, don’t have the resources to expand to groups who don’t speak Welsh or don’t speak English. So we haven’t been able to give as much... Well, we haven’t been able to give any focus to them, unfortunately. We did try people – going back to the grants – if people couldn’t afford devices, technology, wi-fi or broadband or whatever, then we tried to help them as much as we could. I think we’ve done the best we could. There are, of course, there are always going to be some people who are missing out or who we’ve done nothing or not enough with them. But I’d say, on the whole, we’ve done what we could.
19:09
INT: Yes, I’m sure. More than everything, I’m sure. From those who used or engaged in the technology, what do you think was their main motivation for doing so and to then continue using the technology?
R: I’d say their main motivation was... They wanted a chat. They wanted to continue with some kind of engagement with someone who understood, who was in the same situation as them. Especially at the start of the pandemic, there was such a shock to everyone’s system, especially with the first lockdown. That was a heck of a lockdown, looking back. And people were very willing to try new things. And with the support we had from [name of organisation] and so on, we’ve been able to work with a good number of people we would never have been able to work with in this way. And to continue with this way of working, I think people now... They see that it’s working. There’s more willingness to try working with technology. People understand technology better. We’ve had to. We’ve all had to understand technology a bit more. It’s not so... Well, it doesn’t scare people as much as it did before – going to have a conversation. It’s also become a part of everyday life. And I think there’s willingness to continue because that’s the norm now compared to two years ago when... well, it wasn’t the norm at all.
21:16
INT: Yes, I can relate to that myself, certainly. This question’s quite specific, so if there’s no answer that’s no problem. Were there any users who tried using technology before stopping and if so, do you know why they stopped and what, if anything, could have helped them to continue to engage with the service?
21:40
R: Yes, there were. There were. Some people, from what I understand... Some people just don’t like talking online. Which is a very personal matter. It’s not for everyone. Even though we’ve moved forward as much as we have, it’s not for everyone. What we did do if we couldn’t get any kind of contact or engagement with people online is we picked up the phone – went back to the, looking back, old fashioned way of having a conversation on the phone. Once again, poor signal as well. And no matter what we tried, the signal was exceptionally poor in some, not many, but in some areas. Yes, that’s it, I think.
22:45
INT: Yes, thanks for that. If your service users had any technical difficulties, what support was provided to them, if any?
R: [name of organisation] and also the officers we have, they were exceptionally good, fair play. They’re technical. They understand the ins and outs. They were on the phone. For example, Zoom. They would talk with the stroke survivors or the carers through the process of joining Zoom or to start a new account on Zoom, and then how to join a session. So there was a bit of support from us, but also with external partners, to ensure as many people as we could would join the sessions.
23:57
INT: Great. Thanks. One issue we know can be an obstacle for some older people is fear of using technology, either because they don’t want to break the devices or a fear of scams online. Was this a problem with the older people you worked with and if so, was there anything you could do to overcome or avoid those fears?
24:21
R: This did come up quite a bit – that people were scared. And that older people were scared, that is. We didn’t hear so much with people of working age or younger people. This also was a reason, and I didn’t think until you said now, why not everyone was willing to go online. There was a fear that if they put information – any kind of information – it could be picked up. Privacy is, of course, something we assure everyone. We’re not going to pass their information on. Whatever they give is kept completely confidential. We did have these conversations with people. We just did what we could. We also explained to them things like data protection and GDPR and so on. So as to try to ensure the fears they had were... Tried to assure them that we did... Tried to give them some sense of confidence in using technology, but, well, everyone’s different, aren’t they?
25:52
INT: Yes, definitely. The last question in this section is, turning it around a little, to ask about you and your colleagues. So what effect did using technology in this way have on you and your colleagues and the work that you do?
26:11
R: We, before the pandemic, we tended to meet up face-to-face. It has helped, especially as everyone’s working from home now as well. We did have an office before the pandemic. Everyone works from home now. I do feel that everyone’s tired at the moment. We’re all... There are so many meetings online and people do get tired. But it’s helped people, by using the technology, to be able to carry on day to day work. And it’s just been a way to stay in touch with the team and make sure the team is alright. Not just the people we work with, but to ensure the team is alright. Technology also... The best thing about face-to-face is the questions and the conversations one can have. Using technology of course is the next best thing. The telephone is not always the best. But with technology you can share a screen and can see exactly what the problem is. It has been a great help to maintain focus and carry on with what we’re trying to do.
27:47
INT: Thanks for that. And thanks for all the answers to a bit of a marathon of questions. There are just a couple left to close, if that’s alright. And then I’ll hopefully not cause you too much Teams fatigue by keeping you here for a full hour. But before the question kind of looking ahead, I want to ask are there any unexpected positive effects of using digital technology to alleviate loneliness or any unexpected negative effects that you’ve seen?
28:23
R: Well, the positive is that we’ve been able to stay in touch. And that’s been a heck of a positive, to be honest. Some people, especially in more rural areas, where there weren’t many activities any way, they’ve been able to get a lot more because of technology than they did before things went online. Negative... It hasn’t worked for everyone. Not everyone has been able to join. Without doubt, some people have missed out. The feedback we’ve had from people is that they want to continue with the blended approach or this hybrid approach. I think that’s positive as well, to be honest. People do appreciate that their world has opened up compared to... Well, I think before the pandemic everyone lived in their own little world and carried on with their own little lives. It’s opened people’s eyes to the fact there’s a world outside their own square mile. And also all the different activities - and not just us as an organisation, but other organisations we work with as well -  which people can join and people can have the confidence now to do different things. People are a little bit more willing to join with activities or sessions or discussions now than they were before. So I do think it’s been... Of course, there have been many challenges over the last two years, but I do think with the technology, people’s way of thinking has changed and I think that’s a positive thing.
30:29
INT: Thanks for those comments. Last question. You’ve talked a bit about this already so sorry there’s a bit of repetition in the question. In your answer to the questionnaire you said you foresee over the coming months there’ll be a balance between face-to-face support and remote support. Why do you think it’ll be a combination of the two that you’ll proceed with?
R: Why?
INT: Yes.
30:59
R: Because of the feedback we’ve had. And the feedback has been very powerful feedback. And we have engaged with... I was looking at it... 136 people we’ve engaged with, asking, in the next months, looking ahead, what kind of way would you like to see us engaging with you, range of activities, and this and that. Because of the feedback with some saying they’d like to continue with the technology element and would also like some face-to-face because everyone wants to return to some form of normality. And that’s what’s driven us to this way of thinking. And as I said, Wales has now become a lot smaller because of the conversations... I’m thinking now of the Welsh group we’ve got and from four parts of Wales, we have people having conversations, and some people weren’t having a conversation with anyone in Welsh from one week to the next or one month to the next. And now, weekly, they’re having conversations with people in Welsh. We don’t want to lose that and they don’t want to lose that either. But of course people do want the human contact back. So that’s why we’re thinking the way we are at the moment.
32:33
INT: Great. Thanks for that. That was the last question of the interview. Thank you very much again for your contribution in terms of the questionnaire and this. I really really appreciate it. In terms of the next steps of the research, interviews are taking place in January and February and then the research team will write back about this with the team at Bath University, who’s working with them on the project. If you’d be interested to hear how the research is going, we could send you updates when it reaches the next step if you’re interested.
33:08
R: Yes, that would be of great interest, to be honest. And also to share with colleagues.
33:13
INT: OK, right. I’ll make a note of that, no problem. But yes, thank you very much. It was very interesting, personally, to hear about the work you’re doing. Thanks again.
R: Nice talking with you.
INT: And with you. Bye.
R: Goodbye.













					
Recording Details:		P018

	




























Int:	Okay, so yes, the first thing that I’m going to ask about is some background, so it would be great if you’d tell me a little bit about your role in the organisation that you work for.
R:	Okay, so I work for [name of organisation] as a [job title], and my role involves working with people ranging in age from 50, and I think my oldest customer is mid-90s, so quite a range there.  I work in a very disadvantaged area of [name of city], which is a large council estate effectively, although some people do own their own homes, with a reputation for high crime rates and poverty basically.
	I have been working from home throughout the pandemic and I still am.  Originally that was due to self-isolating myself, but now it’s due to an eye problem I’ve got which means I can’t drive, which is ongoing.  I don’t know whether it will be resolved.  So all of my work has been done by phone, email, Teams meetings and Zoom meetings basically.
	I’ve got 61 customers.  To give you some idea how that customer base grew, I think I had 23 pre-pandemic.  That rose to well over 100, which was very, very difficult to manage, as you can imagine.  It’s now down to about 61, which is still quite a high number for somebody who only works 15 hours a week.  But the fact that I’m doing this by phone does mean that I can contact more of them each week than I would have been able to had I been on the ground amongst them.
	Twenty of my customers have access to some form of IT, whether that be themselves, their carer, their support worker, or a relative.  So that’s broadly a picture of what I do.  My role really involves signposting people to any avenue that can help them, so that could be an event for them to go to, to meet new people, or it could be bin issues from the council, for instance, or if they needed some home adaptations I could refer them to the relevant people.  So that’s about it really.
Int:	And you talked about how your customer base has grown.  How do people find out about you or how are they referred to you?
R:	Okay, well referrals are through a variety of means. I get referrals from GP surgeries, from the Red Cross, from the tenancy office.  I even get some of my customers saying they’re worried about somebody else.  I’ve had self-referrals.  So it’s from a variety.  Other community agents if the person doesn’t live in their area.  Age Connect refer people to me.  Alzheimer's Society, they’ve referred people to me.  It’s quite a wide variety really.  
	And my background, for many years I worked for [name of organisation] and I was the employer and partnership manager for [part of] Wales.  So partnerships are quite important to me, and I know how important they are in a working environment.  So I think I did make a lot of partnerships at the beginning of my work as a community agent, which was in, I started in April 2019.  So that could be why so many different places refer to me, because I introduced those networks when I first started the role.
Int:	And how would you describe or what would you say is the main purpose of your role?
R:	It’s to befriend people and to help them access the service that’s right for them at that time.  Because of the nature of where my work is, a lot of my customers have numerous issues.  You climb one hurdle and then another one pops up.  There's a problem with transport, for example.  Even though it’s only about a mile and a half from [name of city] town centre, there is a huge issue with people being able to access things in the town centre, because the buses are very poor and not all of my customers have their own transport.  
	So there are numerous kinds of issues.  There’s a lot of problems with drugs, for instance.  Quite a few of my customers live in fear, basically, of thugs, drug dealing, that sort of thing.  So I don’t actually live in the area.  I live eight miles away in a pretty little village which is like chalk and cheese really, but because of my role with [name of organisation] I did know the area that I work in quite well previously, because I had a member of staff stationed there.
	So I knew what the problems were, but I don’t think I knew the scale of them before I started speaking to people.  There is a great deal of loneliness as well, because although people live on a big estate, some of them are completely on their own, no family, what they perceive to be no friends, although when you get talking to them you do find, well they have got friends.  Problems with people living in flats with noisy neighbours and, as I said before, drug dealing.  It is quite a deprived area.
Int:	How much of your role or the work that you do is focused on preventing loneliness?
R:	Quite a lot in that I get information about local events.  A lot of the other community agents you will find organise events for their customers to go to.  I don’t have to do that because there's lots of events going on already.  They get quite a lot of money from Welsh government as part of various funding streams, and there is quite a lot, a big organisation called [name of organisation] which has quite a few staff itself, and they draw funding from here, there and everywhere, and there are lots of events going on locally.  So I’ve never really felt the need to organise an event.
Int:	Thank you.  That’s really helpful background.  Thinking back to the beginning of the pandemic or the early days of the pandemic, do you remember much about how your work changed?
R:	Well my work going back to, when was it, March 2020, used to involve visiting customers in their homes, discussing any needs with them and then referring them.  Now, because I’m working from home because of my eye problem, it’s the same but it’s by phone.  So obviously there is a barrier there in that I can’t see a person.  I have got a hearing problem, so that can be an issue, although to be fair it’s not been as big an issue as I thought it might be, working by phone.  But I can deal with a lot more people by phone than I could when I was driving round quite a large estate.  
	So that’s the main change for me really. I can still refer them. I can still do exactly what I did before, but before whereas I might sit with somebody and do a Blue Badge application, now what I have to do is use an advocate.  But we’ve got some of those.  We’ve got plenty of those locally, so I can arrange for them to go and sit with the person and do it.
	The only other thing I think that’s changed is that services aren't as accessible, particularly the local authority, because if one of my customers even still rings the council, they get a message saying that “It’s not been possible to answer your call, please leave a message,” and then nobody ever gets back to them.  However I can email the council, because I’ve got an email address, and I can get issues like bins, that sort of thing, sorted out quite quickly for them.
	There is an issue I think with some energy companies in that if people have got a really high bill, which is obviously very topical at the moment, they themselves have to speak to the energy company.  I can’t do it on their behalf, because they won't speak to me.  So there are a few little issues which I suppose if I was visiting somebody would be overcome a little easier.  But generally speaking it’s similar really.  I can still refer people.
Int:	Looking at the responses you gave to the survey, which I’m sure you don’t remember -
R:	No [laughs].
Int:	- but one of the questions is about when you started using technology with older adults to, well, for the purpose of trying to prevent loneliness, and you responded that this is something that started after the first lockdown or since the first lockdown of the pandemic in March 2020.
R:	Yes.
Int:	Can you remember back to what kind of conversations were had in your organisation with colleagues or others about how technology could be used to mitigate loneliness during the pandemic?
R:	Yes.  Well [name], who’s one of the commissioning team at the council, secured a grant.  I think it was the, oh what was it called?  And it’s some kind of inclusion grant to provide iPads for customers, and I managed to get four of those, and I’ll just give you a couple of very quick case studies.
	I’ve got a lady who’s not very old, she’s 55, 56, but she’s got a coil fitted in her brain and she’s got lots and lots of health issues, and I’ve been dealing with this lady for two years off and on, originally because she needed to get to [hospital], but because of something that’s happened in her past, she is terrified of going in a car because she can’t, roundabouts give her a big, big problem.  Now I’ve not dug too deep into that because that’s not my role really.  But I ended up having to organise for somebody to go with her on a train to get to this appointment to see a brain specialist.
	This lady has got a brother who’s also got numerous health issues, and in fact he was isolating in the early part of the pandemic because of his health.  Now he only lives probably about two miles away, but neither has their own transport, and so one of the iPads was given to her and one was given to her brother, even though he’s not in my area, I shouldn't really have done that, but hey-ho, which enabled them to keep in touch with each other daily on Facetime, and for her to know that he was okay and vice versa, because she does worry, really worry, and she’s got various mental health issues as well.
	So obviously you can’t just give somebody an iPad and expect them to know how to use it.  So I did do a course which wasn’t very good.  It told me what I already knew.  I was hoping it might tell me where to begin with this training, but it didn’t.  So what I did is I produced something very basic with some safety tips on, you know, be very careful, don’t give your password, blah, blah, blah, and some very basic instruction really, which I was able to email her because she did have an email address.  So hopefully that helped.  That was one story.
	Another story was another customer who’s not very old, but again got multiple health issues, including spina bifida, problems with his kidneys, all sorts of things.  He’s got custody of his granddaughter and it enabled him to help her with her school work and that sort of thing as well.  So that was quite useful.  
	So as I say, we did get four iPad.  Or they weren’t iPads.  They were tablets, but which hopefully did help.  But what I do find is a lot of the older people, particularly in their 70s and 80s don’t want to know about anything IT.  It scares them.  So I think what would be helpful is some one to one tuition from somebody who’s qualified, not from me, but from somebody who can explain the very basics, because I think they only need to know online banking, supermarket shopping online, and an email really.  If they knew that; that would open so many doors for them.  
	I mean speaking from personal experience, my husband’s one of these people, he’s a pipe fitter so he’s never had to use technology in his job.  He’s now a carer for his mum so he still doesn’t have to use it really, and he’s got me, and teaching him to do online banking, it’s very scary for somebody who hasn’t got a clue.  I mean the only reason I’ve always worked with Word and Excel etc, so it’s the old adage, the more you use it, the more experienced you get, the more comfortable you get.  But for some of these old people it is scary. 
Int:	That’s very interesting and resonates with what Rita was saying yesterday too.  So, other that providing the tablets, I guess with some of the other customers that you’ve been talking about, were there other ways in which they were supported to use technology other than just provision of equipment?
R:	I’ve been able to tell them, even if it’s their carer or a support worker or a relative, about events going on.  To give you an example, last week I was able to send an email to the 20 people who are online, telling them about a new mental health hub which is situated actually right in the middle of the estate, a walk and talk group that was going on, and a women’s group that was going on.  And what I do, I’ll just turn round a second to show you.  Can you see that?
Int:	You haven't got the camera on.
R:	Oh haven't I?
Int:	No.
R:	Hang on, let me put it on.  Sorry.  So I tend to print things off and then send them to people, or I print them off so I can tell people over the phone, but I’ll take a screenshot of it and I can email all the info to people, which has been quite useful.  I’m just having a look at my notes now in case there’s anything I’ve forgotten to tell you.
Int:	Just going back to the early days of the pandemic when I guess we were going into lockdown, so you talked about the community team providing these four tablets, and I guess sort of thinking about people who already had devices and how they could be supported to connect with others using their own devices, what did you think were the pros and cons of using technology to prevent loneliness among your customer group during the lockdown? 
R:	Well I think the cons are obviously getting people to sign up for it.  I’ve got one lady who’s in her 60s, she’s quite smart generally, but she won't hear of it.  She keeps saying, “No, fraud,” and I keep saying, “No, you can protect yourself from that.”  And it’s so time consuming having to ring her every time there’s something she might be interested in, whereas if I could just email it to her it would be so much easier.  But I think we’ve got to accept that there will be people that have got a brick wall up and nothing you can do can knock that down.
	The pros are that you can get information out to a lot of people very quickly.  They can keep in touch with what’s going on locally.  I’ve even put people in touch with each other who didn’t know each other before, just so they’ve got a friend.  And that’s worked out quite well, although you’ve got to be quite careful when you do that they both agree etc.  So there are obviously advantages, but I do think it’s an uphill struggle with a lot of the older people.
Int:	Why do you think that is?
R:	Because of the need for training, because they can’t just go on and do it on their own.  And there was at one point an offer of some telephone training, but my personal thoughts are it needs to be one to one and face to face.  Obviously we have got courses running, which again are online, so it’s not ideal if you’ve got somebody who hasn’t got a clue.  It’s okay if somebody’s got a little bit of know-how.  
	The local college does online courses, which I have told people about, because some people, I can send them an email and I know that they can’t respond to that email.  And very few people do respond to my emails actually, because I don’t think they know how.  But at least I know that I’ve sent the info and hopefully they can see it and then make a judgement whether or not they want to partake.
Int:	I’ve just got reminded actually.  You said at the beginning that of your 60 something customers at the moment, 20 or so have access to IT equipment.
R:	Yes.
Int:	But does that mean that the remaining 40 don’t have any -
R:	No.
Int:	- access at all?  Okay.
R:	No.  I mean a lot of them have got mobile phones, so I can text them.
Int:	And then you’ve mentioned the need for training.  So, to what extent is that a completely unmet need, or have some of the customers you're aware of, are you aware of some of your customers accessing some form of training?
R:	Only one or two really, and I think that might have been because of the pandemic as well.  They may have felt, because a lot of people are still very, very scared to venture outside their front door, which is very sad isn't it really?
	My role as well has been to try and coax them, which has been difficult because of all the mixed messages; stay in, don’t go out, you must protect yourself, and the next minute, oh it’s okay, go out, go out, then again, no you’ve got to stay in again.  So the same with COVID jabs really.  The lady with the brain injury is convinced that having a COVID jab would make her condition worse, and you’ve got to be very careful.  You can say, “It’s not,” but at the end of the day that’s her belief and she’s not going to change it due to something I’ve said. 	
	So IT has been useful to be telling people about COVID pop-up clinics, vaccination clinics and testing centres, because again we’ve had several of those right in the middle of the estate where people can get to.  So it has been useful for that as well.
Int:	You touched on this already so I know the answer’s yes, but perhaps you can say a bit more about this, if there is more to say, but has technology been more successful at reducing loneliness and isolation for some groups of older people compared to others?
R:	Yes I think it has marginally but not as much as it could have been, due to the training and the effects of COVID obviously.  I think people have sort of seen the need to go online, but seeing the need and actually doing it are two different things, aren't they really?
Int:	If you think about the people that it has worked for, well can you tell me a bit about where it has worked?
R:	I’m trying to think.  Some of the customers I weren’t aware were online, but a lot of people, particularly if somebody’s got dementia, I tend to talk to a relative instead, because I’m quite aware that a phone call from somebody, who somebody with dementia may have forgotten in between calls, can be quite, you know, I don’t want people stood there worrying, who’s that that’s just phoned me.  
	So I do tend to talk to the daughter or the son, and that’s been quite useful, because often they are IT literate and I can send them info, and they can then pass it on.  So that’s been quite useful and I would say I’ve spoken to a lot more relatives since the pandemic than I did before.  Before it was usually just the customer I was speaking to.
Int:	Is there anyone that you’re aware who tried using technology and then stopped?
R:	Say again, sorry.
Int:	Are you aware of anyone who tried using technology during the pandemic but didn’t carry on with it?
R:	No, not really, no.  I think if they’ve tried, they’ve usually tried their best and persevered, yeah.  Even my husband [laughs].
Int:	So when you’re talking about the ones who didn’t get on with it at all, that was sort of a complete refusal to engage with it?
R:	Yes.  She wouldn't even try.  I even offered her one of these tablets which, hand on heart, I did think to myself at the time, I can’t just give her a tablet.  She does need help.  But I was quite willing to go over it on the phone with her, which is not ideal, but it would have been better than nothing.  But she wouldn't even entertain it, and she is quite a stubborn lady.  So I didn’t pursue it really.
Int:	In the survey you talked about barriers that made using technology difficult for the older people that you worked with, and one of the ones that you said was like a considerable problem was hardware or software issues.  Do you know if people who were trying to use technology but encountered hardware and software issues, do you know if any support was provided to them?
R:	I’m trying to think back now.  I think what I might have meant by that is perhaps not hardware, software issues, but broadband issues, and in particular the cost of broadband, because with these tablets people have to buy credit to use them, and the guidance that we had wasn’t that clear for me to pass on.  And I did try to get more clear information so that I could tell people, because the first thing somebody’s going to ask is how much is it going to cost me?  So you need to be able to answer that.  
	It was a little bit woolly, the info we got, and I think that might have been because the lady who organised it is not really very IT savvy herself.  So she may not have asked the questions to the powers that be above her.
Int:	So what was missing from the guidance or what was it unclear about?
R:	Well I think the info she gave me was, oh I think they’ve got to do this, and I think they go to a shop and buy this. Well think [inaudible 31:08], we needed to know rather than think, because I didn’t feel confident passing on that info, which wasn’t very clear.
Int:	Do you think that ended up being a barrier that prevented people from continuing to use the technology?
R:	I think that could have been a barrier. I don’t know whether it was, but I definitely think the high cost of broadband could be a barrier.
Int:	Do you know if anyone, I know in some places people had financial support for covering these costs.  Was that something that the people you worked with had access to?
R:	No, not that I was aware of, no.
Int:	You mentioned the fear of scams, one of the people that you work with who wouldn’t use technology because she was afraid of scams, is that right?
R:	Yes.
Int:	How common is that as a barrier for people?
R:	I’ve only heard of it once. So I wouldn't say it was that common.
Int:	What do you think could be done to help people overcome that fear?
R:	I think again a one to one, face to face training, where you could explain to somebody, you don’t give your password, you stay safe online basically.  I didn’t go into any depth with this lady because I couldn't get over the first hurdle with her.  But I think some one to one help may have been able to convince her.  I don’t know.  She is very stubborn.
Int:	Were there any unexpected positive effects of using technology to address loneliness during the pandemic?
R:	I think one of the positive aspects of, I’ll give you an example.  Before Christmas one of the ladies who used to work in our office arranged a Christmas lunch, and it was a three course Christmas lunch with entertainment at a local restaurant with £10 towards transport, and it was free, presumably paid for by some grant from somewhere.  
	So I was able to tell 20 people immediately by email, because that was quite quick for me to do, but the other 40 people I had, it was quite difficult to tell them in the timeframe because I only work 15 hours.  My phone calls are spread over a month.  If I speak to somebody today, depending on their needs it’s usually another month before I speak to them.  They’ve got my number so they can contact me in between.
	So it was very useful to be able to just email stuff, and out of all the people I did manage to tell, which was probably 90% of my customers, 12 of them actually went along for this meal.  And I’ve spoken to two or three of them since to find out how it went, and they really, really enjoyed it, meeting new people, which again is a way to combat loneliness, because if you meet new friends you can go on days out etc.
	I’ve got one customer, [name], who again is not very old, he’s in his early 60s, you probably think he’s old [laughs], but in comparison with me he’s not too old.  He lost his wife five years ago, but he still talks about her as if it was yesterday.  Every single time I phone him, he says, “and [name] would have done this and [name] would have done that,” and it’s quite sad because he would love a friend, but I don’t think he’s got the mental capacity to be able to use IT, which is a shame.  
	But he has got some learning issues.  I don’t know what they are but I don’t think he’d be able to use IT. So he’s been stuck in a top floor flat on his own.  He’s lucky he’s got a little balcony that he can sit on.  He’s got a brother but he hasn’t got anybody else in the whole wide world.  And it is quite sad that people like that are excluded from a lot of things. But as I say, I don’t think he’d be able to use IT.  Perhaps that’s unfair.  Perhaps if there was some one to one training he could try.
Int:	I suppose, I mean I suppose perhaps other people with similar needs to him, they might have someone caring for them who would help them get online.
R:	Yes, yes that’s what I’ve found, especially with people with dementia.  I’m talking to their son or daughter and I’m able to pass the info through them, which, as I say, it saves me talking to the person and getting them worried if they have got dementia.  It’s a quick way for me to get any messages out, just ping an email, and it’s useful for the relative as well, because the relative often doesn’t know which way to turn.  
	So what I’m finding as well is that social workers locally just seem to be dropping people, and carers are just sort of left to get on with it and I know that from my husband.  He cares for his mum.  They’re just left to get on with it, and because the family do get on with it, then they’re just left alone but they don’t get any help such as respite care or anything like that.  It’s a very rewarding job speaking to these people, and even a very quick phone call once a month, some of them’ll say, “Oh you’re an angel,” and I think, well I’m not an angel.  I haven't done anything.  But you might have been the only person that person’s spoken to in the whole of that time.  Very, very sad.
Int:	If you look back over the time since the pandemic and how technology has been used to prevent loneliness, what would you say are the biggest lessons from that?
R:	I think the biggest lesson for me would be if you want older people to partake then you have to give them one to one tuition at the beginning, and I think once they’ve got that basis, they will improve themselves by using it.  I think that’s probably, and maybe look at cheaper deals for broadband to make it more affordable for them to do that, because there's lots of Zoom groups and Teams groups that people can access, but they can only access it if they know how.  So they’re discounting a lot of the older ones that way.
Int:	Okay, well thank you very much [name].  I’m going to stop the recording now.

Int:	Just to start us off just some background questions about your role and the organisation that you work for. Could you just give a brief overview of what you do and who you work for?
R:	I’m [job title and name of organisation]. It’s funded by the Welsh Government through the [name of fund] I think it is. The job is to provide information and support to over 50s within my area. It’s a small village called [name of village]. There’s about 19 of us in [name of city] so we cover all the different villages. 
Int:	Who is it that you work for?
R:	I work for [name of organisation] and [name of council] oversees it. They have commissioners from [name of council]. Before I did this job, I was a trained nurse and a health visitor so as I’ve retired, I’ve gone on to do two days in this job. 
Int:	I’m guessing that it’s just you that’s doing this role for [name of organisation].
R:	Yes. 
Int:	You said there were …
R:	There in other villages in [name of city] as community agents. 
Int:	Would you say that you have colleagues?
R:	I’d say yes. We haven’t been able to meet face to face very much during the pandemic but we do have Zoom meetings and I have met them a couple of times so if you run into an issue, you can contact people who’ve been doing the job a bit longer. 
Int:	You said that your role is providing information and support to over 50s. Could you tell me a bit more about what that entailed? 
R:	Some of the job involved signposting people to other services. Some part of the role is visiting elderly, vulnerable people in their homes and the other part of it is setting up groups where there’s gaps within the provision of whatever is in the village. I’ve set up walking football, a walking group, a Zoom coffee morning and a dementia support group. Those are my groups. 
	I think particularly during the pandemic I have visited more people who were shielding or were scared to go out. So I’ve visited quite a lot of people in their nineties. It varies and I get referrals from social care, community councillors. I get self-referrals, neighbours, police. As you’re in the job the role grows really as people get to know you’re there. 
Int:	So you’ve been doing home visits during the pandemic. 
R:	We had a brief time where we had to stop. I think after Christmas last year with the second lockdown we stopped for about six weeks and that was quite difficult because you were telephoning people but it wasn’t quite the same. 
Int:	In your role how much focus is there on preventing loneliness and isolation?
R:	I think it’s quite a big part of the role. I think a lot of the role is that. Even the group work, it’s about getting healthy but it’s also about meeting other people so I’d say about 90% of the role. 
Int:	In your experience when you think about the different types of older people that you work with, who is most affected by loneliness, would you say?
R:	People that live on their own. People who had to shield. People who are carers. They may have another person in the house but that person might have dementia. People who have been very active socially seemed to really struggle because maybe they were a widow and their way of coping was going out to lots of groups and when they stopped, they felt really at sea. They didn’t know how to fill their time. 
Int:	So people who before the pandemic were very active struggled more. 
R:	Yeah, I would say, and the very elderly who had been used to people visiting them and then nobody was visiting them at all. Housebound. 
Int:	Going back to the early days of the pandemic, what sort of conservations were had with colleagues in the community council and the council about how you might use or how digital technologies could be used?
R:	Well, one suggestion was to set something up on Zoom, a weekly coffee morning which is still running actually, because at least people could connect online then. [Name of council] also provided some tablets to be used to decrease loneliness amongst the elderly. So, the idea was I think we had three each that we would go up and set tablets up for people which it was assumed that you would be able to do that. I’m lucky because my husband is very good so he helped me but there was the option to give out a tablet to people so they could connect online. Also, if people didn’t know how to contact their families on FaceTime you could help them to set up FaceTime and things like that so they could speak to people. The downside of that, well there’s two really, A, some people haven’t got any way of doing that and, B, you get the comment, “I’m too old to learn something new like that. I can’t do it,” and just point-blank refuse to do it. 
Int:	I’m going to pick up on a couple of things that you said there. With the devices, the tablets, how did you decide who would get those or how was that managed?
R:	I put it out on my Facebook page to say, “Does anybody want one?” One of the community councillors live next to a 92-year-old gentleman who wanted to join the Zoom coffee morning because he was completely isolated. He didn’t go out at all. We gave him one and his neighbour, he still does it now, goes round and puts it on for him because he’s 93. He comes on and he absolutely loves it. It’s the highlight of his week he says because he still doesn’t go out. Particularly during the first and second lockdowns he didn’t see anybody, so that was him. 
	I’ve still got one here. Another lady wanted it. What did she want it for? I think it was to go on FaceTime with her niece but then we discovered when I took it round that the SIM card only lasted for a few weeks and she wasn’t going to be able to afford to replace it so that was a bit of a barrier really. She gave it me back in the end because she said she couldn’t work it. 
	That was a barrier that if you haven’t got wi-fi because some of them haven’t because they haven’t got a computer or a laptop, they couldn’t really afford to be paying £15 for a SIM card when they’re on pension credits. Another community council actually paid for the SIM cards but mine wouldn’t.  
Int:	You’ve talked about a few of the different things that were done with technology but in the early days when I guess everyone was looking at what was coming or adjusting to the new reality that we were in in the lockdown and stuff, can you remember when you were discussing this with colleagues what you were considering when you were thinking about using technology?
R:	Just really considering how we could connect people really and alleviate loneliness and social isolation. Another agent set up a Zoom coffee morning and she said it was working well so I went on hers to see how it worked and then that helped me to set mine up. What else did we discuss? Just the fact that the loneliness was really affecting peoples’ mental health because I suppose it’s something we take for granted, but just having people to talk to face to face, once it went, they were just completely on their own and the days were long. The second lockdown I think was particularly difficult because it was December, January, February, wasn’t it? Dark nights and horrible weather and some people just couldn’t cope with it. 
Int:	When you’re having those sorts of conversations in the early days or thinking about how technology might be used with the people that you work with what did you and colleagues think were the pros and cons of using technology in this way?
R:	I think the cons were that people didn’t access the internet at all or didn’t have a device which they could. Another con was that I think I said to you before, they were unwilling to learn a new skill. There were a lot that were, really elderly, just couldn’t. I don’t think they could cope with it really, to be honest. They would struggle to do anything online. On the plus side there were people that were very keen to learn and we had access to classes for them if they wanted to do a digital course. 
	There were people who had never used it before who after a couple of weeks mastered it. Zoom is not that difficult once you’ve done it a few times, is it? Said, “Oh, I never thought I’d be able to do that,” and I think it gave them confidence about going online and doing other things. I might have to spend a bit of time with them in the beginning setting up Zoom for them and what have you but once they got a link through on an email and just pressed it, they were fine. I mean I knew nothing about Zoom. I don’t think any of us did really before the pandemic. Everybody always says to me, “Oh, you’re an expert on it.” I was like, “Well, just trial and error, isn’t it? You just learn as you go along.” 
Int:	It sounds like there was a real range. 
R:	There was. 
Int:	The people that it worked for do you think there was anything common to those people?
R:	I think they were the sort of people who did go out a lot and join a lot of groups. I think the ones who didn’t embrace it were the really older ones, the 90-year-olds. As they said to me, they couldn’t do anything because everything had to be done online because face to face contacts, like if they had to contact the Department of Work and Pensions or anything it was all done online and they just really struggled with it because they just couldn’t get their heads round how the computer worked. So I think the ones who really embraced it were the ones who were maybe a little bit younger. I am generalising now because there are one or two in their 90s who were quite good on the internet but they were generally younger, in their 70s sort of age group who were used to trying new things. 
Int:	Okay, that’s interesting. I don’t want to put words in your mouth but it sounds to me like you were saying that the people who it tended to work for were people who had already been quite sociable.
R:	Mmm. 
Int:	Would it then follow that the people that it didn’t work so well for were already?
R:	Yeah, possibly. I think there were others, like the one I was just telling you about, the 93-year-old man who never used it who did enjoy it but needed help. He doesn’t go to any groups or anything. He doesn’t go anywhere really. So they were a bit of a mix but I’d say generally, yes. Generally, I’d say they were the more sociable type of person. 
Int:	If you think overall about how technology is being used, [inaudible 00:13:40] in technology since the pandemic, do you think it’s been a success?
R:	I think it has, yeah. It’s been a lifeline to some people. 
Int:	What does success mean in this context?
R:	It means people have been able to contact each other through a different medium than they’ve been used to and it also means they become more proficient online and more confident about doing other things online as well. 
Int:	For the people who did engage with the technology, what do you think their motivation was to do so and to keep engaging?
R:	Well, to be able to talk to other people and, also, they made new friends. Some of the groups have gone on to meet in person. Our Zoom group which is still on Zoom has been out three times and the people that were on it didn’t know each other before so they’ve actually made new social contacts. I think it was just to relieve the monotony in the beginning as well because every day was the same. 
Int:	So the Zoom coffee morning group that you were talking about, they’ve met in person since. 
R:	They have, yeah. We had a strawberry tea for them in the summer which we combined with a place where some of them lived which there’s a home but there’s bungalows at the back which are rented out so we had a strawberry tea there. Everybody came from there plus the Zoom coffee morning and they really enjoyed that. Then we’ve had a Christmas meal out as well because I had a grant for the strawberry tea and I had a bit of money left over. I paid for both. Not me personally but [name of council] have paid for both which they liked because they didn’t have to pay.  
Int:	How many people came?
R:	I’d say the height of the pandemic there was 10, sometimes 12. Now it’s down to six. I keep saying, “Shall we stop it now?” “No, no, we like it. We like to meet up.” They say particularly they want to meet up with a gentleman who can’t get out I was telling you about in his 90s because apart from his one friend who also comes on Zoom, he’s a councillor, he doesn’t see anybody. They do it for him, they say. 
Int:	If there were people who tried using technology and then stopped, you have mentioned at least one person, do you know why they stopped?
R:	Some people stopped because things opened up so they were back to going out again so they didn’t need it anymore. Some people like that lady stopped because they couldn’t master the tablet and they couldn’t afford the SIM card so cost came into it. I think there’s an assumption that everybody has got wi-fi these days but they haven’t. Some people said it’s not the same as meeting people, which it isn’t, is it? They try it and see if they liked it but when they did try it it didn’t really replace the face-to-face contact.
Int:	You’ve kind of mentioned the people who tapered off when restrictions eased and the people who felt it wasn’t a substitute for face-to-face interaction, and then the ones that stopped for other reasons such as not being to master the technology or the costs of being online. What do you think could be done to help people like that continue?
R:	I think the ones with the cost it would be good if it was some sort of fund for people who are on benefits or pension credits to access within [name of council] because there seems to be a lot of money for some things. What was the other bit of the question, sorry?
Int:	Well, I suppose the other thing you mentioned was people who just weren’t able to master the technology. 
R:	I mean, ideally, they could have gone on a course but there were no courses at the time, were there, face to face? The only courses were online and because they didn’t like the online or didn’t feel confident, they didn’t feel confident enough to do a course so it was a bit of a chicken and an egg thing. One of the community agents does run digital introduction courses to tablets and what have you so he was quite useful, but, again, they were online. 
	I don’t know what the answer is really. Now you could go probably to a course, well maybe you couldn’t at the moment because we’ve got restrictions again, haven’t we? Before these current restrictions you could go to the adult learning college and do a six-week course. For some people that would be better because they relate more to somebody coming in and teaching them and doing it online. In fact, one of the agents who you might speak to, she’s had the digital adult learning college facilitators come into her coffee morning and done some introductory sessions so that’s another way of getting round it if they go into a group that’s already in existence. 
Int:	That’s a really good suggestion. I’m interested because you described that there were some people who needed a bit of help with getting their heads around it but then I’m guessing that it was you who helped them. 
R:	Yes. 
Int:	For those people the support that you provided was enough to help them. 
R:	It was enough to get them on and then talk them through when they couldn’t get the audio to work or the video to work or they could only see one person. That’s the other thing, isn’t it? So, yeah, it was usually me. There wasn’t anybody else, unless it was their son or daughter who had maybe set them up on it sometime. 
Int:	So that worked for some people but then there were people that you tried to help to get online but they …
R:	They couldn’t grasp it or were unwilling to grasp it. They wouldn’t try even. 
Int:	Why do you think that was?
R:	I think it’s because people feel they’re a certain age and they didn’t grow up learning about computers and so they can’t do it. It’s like a mental block really. Whereas I think possibly they could but they’re very worried about they’re going to get scammed, which is understandable, isn’t it? There have been a lot more scamming, so they do worry about that and they don’t want to touch the computer in case that happens. Also, when the computer wants to update, that throws them. They can’t just go on to Zoom because the computer suddenly says it needs to do six updates and they don’t know what to do. 
Int:	With the scam thing, because this is something we’ve been aware of, what do you think could be done to help people overcome those fears?
R:	I think it’s just education really, isn’t it? Talking about what form the scam could take because I think older people tend to think, “Oh, if I get a text or an email from the tax office it’s from the tax office,” so it’s just to make them aware how clever criminals can be and not to answer anything. Never to give their bank details. I think it’s just reiterating it. A lot of them are aware of it, I think, but there are a few. Some of the scams are so sophisticated that they don’t realise it is a scam so it’s talking it through with them. I had, it wasn’t really online so maybe it’s not relevant, but I had somebody that nearly got scammed out of £10,000 by somebody that called round and offered to do some work for them. It was only that they told a neighbour that they realised it was a scam. They can be a little bit gullible at times I think and take people as being genuine when you or I might think, “That doesn’t sound right.” I’m not saying it could never happen because they say even people who are good on computers can get scammed sometimes, can’t they? They’re more likely to, I think, because if the bank gets in contact with them, they think it’s the bank. 
Int:	Did you have people actually say to you that they were scared of being scammed?
R:	Yes, a few. 
Int:	That was why they didn’t …?
R:	They’ll avoid the laptop altogether, yeah. A lot of them have got something in the house but they’re scared to use it. 
Int:	How did this sort of technology use change or what affect did it have on the work that you do as a community agent?
R:	It’s difficult for me to say because I started in April 2020 but talking to the other girls the work went very much from being face to face to online or on the phone so for me it’s actually stopped me doing what I wanted to do because I’d got plans about things I wanted to set up and I couldn’t do it so I had to rethink how my work was going to pan out really. Because I couldn’t visit, I had to think about doing something online. 
	As I say, I’ll have been in the job two years this April but I feel like I’ve only been a year in the job properly because the first year it wasn’t a normal year. Even when it came to the summer you still couldn’t set a group up because there were restrictions on numbers and a lot of the pensioner groups and that that I would have gone into introduce myself weren’t running. I had to completely rethink my role if you like for that time. I must say, I enjoy it more when I can get out and about and meet people. That’s just me. I think it’s my nursing background. I’m used to being out meeting people all day so almost being online was like foreign territory to me, as it was to a lot of people, wasn’t it?
Int:	At what point was it, as you mentioned that initially you weren’t able to do home visits and then that changed, what sort of …?
R:	Well, ours changed because they said that as long as we checked the person was happy for us to go, we wore masks and we did hand sanitising. At that time, you couldn’t do a lateral flow because they didn’t come in then, then we could do home visits. We found that we were picking up a lot of extras because social workers and support workers weren’t doing home visits so we were getting a lot more, because we were going in so we were picking up issues and we were holding them, if you like. We were having to do more. Our job is mainly to signpost other services but other services weren’t going in so it was quite difficult really. 
Int:	It just occurred to me to ask this but the support that you provided people with getting online and using technology to connect, on the whole were you providing that support in person or were you doing it on the phone or a mix?
R:	I’m just trying to think back now. Generally, it was when I could go in face to face unless they’d got Zoom there because their relative had set it up for them and then I would talk it through on the phone with them at that time when we couldn’t go out and do any visits at all. With the tablet I just dropped it off at the person’s house when we’d set up and then rang the gentleman next door to tell him how to access it. 
Int:	How did you find supporting people over the phone?
R:	Hard. I didn’t find it very easy at all because you can have your hands on the device and you can’t see them face to face so you don’t know what button they’re pressing, whereas if you can be with them at least you can say it’s this one or it’s that one. 
Int:	Have there been since the pandemic and you started using technology, have there been any unexpected positive effects of using technology to address loneliness and isolation?
R:	I think it’s enabled people to make new friends. As I was saying, they have now met up in person, people that they didn’t know before and it’s enabled people to share information. That one, U3A, have you heard of that? It seems to be a big online group for over 60s and one or two were on it and they told us about it so they’ve sort of shared information. I think it’s time effective really as well. I could see 10 people in an hour on Zoom whereas it would probably take me a day and a half to see them all in person. What else? I think just enabling them to become confident as well on using technology which they wouldn’t have probably ever used if there hadn’t been a pandemic. 
Int:	With the first point that you made about enabling people to make new friends, so that was through the Zoom coffee morning people made new friends. If there hadn’t been a pandemic and you’d just done an in-person coffee morning would that not have had the same effect?
R:	Possibly but I had one lady who was new to the area who didn’t know anybody and might not have accessed anything but because she’s met people online and they’ve told her about activities. She says I’m her angel. She’s nice. I just saw her one day when I was going to her neighbour, she was just moving in, and I said, “I’ll come and see you.” She’d moved from the [name of city] area and she didn’t know anybody. She’d lost her husband. I enabled her to meet people online and, also, she joined my walking group because she loves walking. So she’s met quite a lot of friends that she probably wouldn’t have met or she wouldn’t have even known where the coffee morning she now goes to in person would have met or may not have had the confidence to go on her own, perhaps. Whereas because she already knew people, she’d met online she could meet up with them and feel [inaudible 00:29:40] go and chat to them because she’s met them online. “Oh, I’m so and so, I’ve seen you online at the coffee mornings.” 
	Now I think for some people, yes, they would have just gone along to something but for other people it was the beginning of a bit of a journey to get to know people. She also got to know people that lived in the complex of bungalows where she lives which apparently is not that friendly and people don’t mix a lot. So through doing Zoom and having the strawberry tea she got to meet a lot of people. She knows everybody now. 
Int:	Wow, that’s really [inaudible 00:30:15]. I’m wondering actually if you’ve done anything to evaluate. 
R:	That’s a good question, [name], no, I haven’t really. Just word of mouth. I probably should do. One of them said for me to tell you that Zoom saved her life at the beginning of the pandemic. I was just talking to her before and I said I’ve got to go because I’m going on this, she said, “I don’t know what I would have done without it,” because she’s a widow. This is a different one. She was shielding at the beginning and she said, “I just wouldn’t have seen anybody or spoken to anybody all week if we hadn’t had that.” So, yeah, maybe I should do an evaluation. 
Int:	I’m just curious to know whether the people that have been using it had shared their views.  
R:	It’s all very positive and I think if they weren’t finding the benefit they wouldn’t on, would they? I’ve had another lady whose son said, “She’s desperate to come,” and he’s put her on and everything but she’s never come so I think well she obviously doesn’t really want to access it, does she? He thinks she should  but she hasn’t. I said to him last week because he goes to the walking football, “Your mum hasn’t been on yet.” “Oh, I’ll get on to it.” It may just be that she’s not confident enough to do it, I don’t know. I’ve not met her. 
Int:	Have there been any unexpected negative effects?
R:	We have one lady that comes on that tends to dominate it and she’s a little bit eccentric, shall we say? One or two of the group don’t like her. That’s difficult because she needs it as much as anybody else. I suppose it’s a little bit harder on Zoom to say nicely, “Can you let somebody else get a word in edgeways?” So we’ve had that. We had one who met somebody that she didn’t like so she didn’t come back, somebody that she knew from the village. You’re always going to get that, aren’t you? Negative is when they can’t get on as well and their connection is breaking up and they’re frustrated because they want to chat to people. That’s a bit negative, isn’t it? I can’t think of anything else off the top of my head. 
Int:	I had a quick look at the survey responses that you gave us. 
R:	I can’t remember what I wrote now it was that long ago. 
Int:	Don’t worry, I’m not going to test you. 
R:	When did I do that, was it October or something like that?
Int:	Probably, yeah. November, maybe. One of the questions that was asked in a survey was what you thought the balance in the coming months would be of face to face versus remote support that you were going to provide in your role. I think that you said you’d anticipated that it’s going to be mostly face to face in the coming months. 
R:	I said that, yeah, but I still can’t stop them. They want to do it. They still want the Zoom as well. I know a lot of them do go out and do other things. They’ve made that little group of friends, they like meeting up and chatting. I’ve suggested that it moves on that one of the councillors could run it and, “Yeah, could do,” but he’s not really committed himself to it because, really, I feel like my role is to initiate it, set it up and move on, that’s what I feel because I only work 16 hours. If I can get them off in an hour and a quarter of my week every week, which I don’t mind, I enjoy it, but I just feel that he could run it as well as me really.
Int:	Why have you decided that the focus of your work is going to be mostly face to face?
R:	I think because I just want to be out there in the community. I feel like I’m having to keep people waiting because I’m doing Zoom things and although it was needed during the pandemic, I don’t think it is so much now. I think there is always going to be a place for it with people that are housebound. Apart from that one gentleman everybody else … well, one lady does just go out for a walk, so I suppose two out of the six do still need it but in my mind my job was to be in the community working face to face with people so that’s why. The thing is, covid hasn’t gone away, has it? We’re in a lockdown again now and then we’ll come out of it and there might be another one in a couple of months so there’s probably always going to be a need for something. 
Int:	What would you say are the main lessons you take from using technology during covid?
R:	I think they should have provided us with some training before we started having to do it. It could have been online because there seemed to be an assumption that we knew what we were doing. I think another lesson is that it’s not for everybody. Some people were never going to embrace it, which again I can understand. I feel like that when you start with it yourself. When your generation has had it all the way through school but if you’re my age you’re generally self-taught, aren’t you? So if you’re not willing to learn or you feel you can’t then it’s not going to happen so that’s a negative from it as well, I think. Also, it doesn’t replace actually meeting somebody face to face.
Int:	Okay. Well, that’s been really helpful, thank you.

INT: Just to confirm, any information you give about yourself or in terms of people and their places will be kept confidential. Also any personal information you give will be kept in terms of data protection. If you want to stop at any point during the interview, just let me know, and you won’t need to answer any questions you don’t want to. But to start with a bit of scene-setting, would you be willing to give a brief overview of your role and the organisation you work for?
00:48
R: Yes. I work for [name of organisation], which is in [part of] Wales. And I work as [job title]. Simply, that’s a job to bring people and children of all ages together. This is the only job of its kind in Britain. But of course the job is developing and the hope is that more local governments will get such jobs in the years to come.
01:21
But back now, in March 2020... Obviously my job entails working face to face with people, so I had much fewer projects going ahead, so I got more and more different responsibilities and one of those was working on the digital agenda. Of course, as an intergenerational co-ordinator, challenging loneliness and isolation is a big part of the work. So one way of doing that was by working on this agenda.
01:57
INT: Thanks. That’s very interesting to hear. Can you talk also about the work your organisation does with older people?
02:06
R: Yes. Specific to bridging the generations, we arrange projects for older people to do things jointly with children and young people. The benefits associated with this type of work are very obvious in research papers and also different work in recent years. I also have completed research work – Master of Research - looking at the benefits and also looking at the challenges and obstacles. And specifically, the work can tackle loneliness, tackle isolation, but also that special relationship that develops and that understanding, without being forced somehow is very special. So that’s the type of work we’re doing. We’re doing this to a great extent to tackle loneliness. But then if we discuss [name of organisation] further, they have lots of different support for older people. If we just look at our team, we’re a very small team in [name of organisation], but I work with bridging the generations, which supports older people. We have [name], who’s the manager of [name of organisation], which supports people living with dementia and their carers. We then have **03:41** and other members of staff working to support unpaid carers. And we also have members of staff supporting mental health, which also has older people coming in there. And I also, since September, have been working on the ageing society agenda, slash age-friendly society, and my role, it’s likely, will change in the coming months to go from bridging generations to that as bridging generations comes under that anyway. So we’re doing a lot of work specifically since September with ageing societies. And during the last months, we’ve distributed £25,000 in small grants to groups across [name of city] to get older people back out into the community and to challenge the loneliness that has come as a result of the pandemic. Yes, we’re continuing with those grants too, so before Christmas we’d have a lot of events. Covid does make it a lot more... a lot more difficult than it would be otherwise. But what we see at the moment is that a lot of these older people want to do things and just do them in the safest way possible. So they want to be able to go out to the community hall and play whist or something, they just want to do it in a safe way. So yes, the [name of organisation] itself does a lot more than that, but that’s an overview of the provision our team provides older people.
05:23
INT: It’s a lot of work by a small team. And a lot of good work, too. So, am I right that there’s more focus in terms of the work with older people and preventing loneliness perhaps, is that different to the work you do with other people, with other things?
R: Yes, so although preventing loneliness comes under bridging generations and is one way of offering that, the workload has changed since September and I’m taking much more work on ageing society. So yes, last February, a draft was released and then in September they released the ageing society strategy in Wales. And so since then I’ve been working with the different departments across [name of organisation] to see how we can ensure we provide the requirements. But also, yes, I’ve been working with [name of city] community contacts, which is.. we have a community contact in five areas of [name of city] which are specifically for supporting older people in those areas – to connect them with different groups and so on. So I’ve been working very closely with them while distributing the grants and while ensuring there are opportunities across [name of city] for older people at the moment.
06:48
INT: Thank you very much. That gives a useful background. I’m going to go on now to ask questions more about the role of digital specifically to prevent loneliness. So if you think back to the early days of the Coronavirus pandemic, what type of conversations were happening in your organisations about how digital technology could be used to prevent or reduce loneliness?
R: It varied from project to project. With my project, I didn’t try to take too many digital projects. And the main reason for that was the matter of safeguarding that arose with DBS and every older person would have to have a DBS because we would be connecting them with someone under 18. So it raised a lot of challenges and we... It was perhaps something scared older people to present them something digital anyway without mentioning something like a DBS, so we didn’t go down that route with that work. But, for example, [name of organisation] very early started holding all their sessions online. And they did this by lending tablets or devices to older people who were already members. And then gave the support over the phone and so on for them to able to get on to do that. But they soon became aware that was a lot of work and they were only a very small team, so they couldn’t support a large number of people because very often it meant being on the phone with the individual for some time before the session started to make sure they felt comfortable enough to join. So they was a limit on how much support they could offer. But they have by now supported lots to go online. But, yes, so at the start, we just did that and started discussing, but we also had a lot of work going on directories, where we gave a one-stop-shop for the support available with the pandemic. But we soon realised we had to give a phone number as well because the people who really needed the support, the older people in society, were not able to reach the information. And then back in August 2020, we started to think seriously that there were lots of different groups and departments in the [name of organisation and city] all with the same aim of supporting more people to go online and so on. And perhaps wanting to do but not knowing how to start. So we started a group – [name of group]. That group included [organisation] staff but also representatives from third sector groups across [name of city]. We also had [name of groups] I don’t remember their names. We had representatives from them as well, so they were able to help us get access to devices as well as needed. So we started establishing that and also learning what we really needed. So what we then did was we worked with a group with an independent information technology advisor, [name], to create a handbook in Welsh and English and then training online which is on YouTube to access whenever anyone needs it. We worked on them because we understood many care staff perhaps didn’t know themselves how to provide the support. So we were still in a period where we couldn’t go to people’s houses to give the support. And perhaps family could but perhaps they wouldn’t have the confidence themselves. And also care staff themselves were worried they couldn’t teach people how to connect with their families. So we did the handbook and this training so that more people could be more confident to teach people to go online. About the same time, the [name of organisation] itself received a lot of devices through grants and then those were then distributed through the community contacts and we worked with the different groups and so on to ensure needs were being met and that people were able to not only receive a device, but also get the information they wanted then, but often to find out who around them was able to provide the support because as Covid was still a concern, it was easier to find if there was a family member or someone in their bubble anyway able to go there and give the support. So, yes, we did the training and that handbook. By now, we still share those with people. One thing that’s great about that training is that they also discuss accessibility on the devices. So that’s something I wouldn’t be familiar with because I’ve never had to look at accessibility on a device. But very often, with older people, it means you can make the text larger or you can change from which side the sound comes in the device. Things I still don’t understand. But we can give these handbooks with this information to people who really could support people. And then, yes that group meets much less now because it was more something we wanted to give information and so on. But we still use it as a kind of mailing list where we can, any information we think is useful for people in the group, we share in the hope they can provide the support. Also the demand for devices has fallen by now as well because I think everyone who was interested has perhaps taken that step a few months ago. But we have been able to provide that support. I think that’s what was most important because I think having access to a device without cost was something so easy during 2021 especially because it was as if everyone was offering devices free of charge. But I think the most important thing was making sure people knew how to use them after receiving them.
13:52
INT: Thanks for that.  It just shows how much extreme change has been in the past couple of years, when you look back. So it was interesting hearing that. You’ve talked a bit already, but what did you and your colleagues see as the main advantages and disadvantages of using the technology for the reasons you’ve described already?
14:19
R:
In terms of advantages, obviously being in touch with family and friends is a very big one. Although people can still phone people, it wasn’t the same. It was that they wanted to see each other and especially the grandmothers and grandfathers who had great grandchildren or young grandchildren. It was very important for them to be able to either Facetime or video call or be able to share photos and videos with each other by email. So we saw that as a reason for many to contact us individually in order to get in touch through the web. But, for example, there’s one lady who received a device back in September and she now can talk regularly with family in Spain. Although they phoned anyway, she can now have a regular video call with them in Spain. And that’s just one example of the small difference it can make. Another advantage is, for example, [name of organisation], they had regular classes and it was a lifeline not only for the individuals who attended but also the carers because they either had that break they needed while they were at the class or they had support from the staff as well. So that has enabled them to regain access to that service. There are many people who live with dementia, for example. You know routine is so important and going to the [name of organisation] was part of that routine, that habit. So it’s important that they can do that, even though it can be quite scary doing it in a completely different way. In the end, they were able to rejoin as they wanted. I don’t know if you’ve seen the video of Swan Lake by [name of organisation], but they did a production online with [name of organisation], where their members and some [name of organisation] staff did a kind of dance to celebrate reconnecting. And I think that shows the strength of technology because they’re all on little screens doing the same dance and you see everyone moving, so that’s amazing. I’ll share the link with you after.
But in terms of disadvantages, one disadvantage – perhaps it’s not a disadvantage of the technology itself – but the feeling some older people had that they had to do this though they didn’t want to. So they felt this was the only solution they had though they didn’t want to do it. And many were concerned, having heard a few scare stories about the internet and the internet also sounds like something so big. It is huge, but it sounds like something beyond. And that’s enough to scare people. We had very many people who were lonely but they just didn’t want to go online. But what we saw then is some then changed their minds as time went by. So perhaps not a disadvantage of technology, but yes, it’s just that idea that scares people. But, yes, I can’t think of a disadvantage.
17:54
Another advantage with technology, we saw, was – and [name of organisation] have done this as well – was being able to do things that are accessible 24 hours a day. Whereas before there would be a set time for the project or whatever and if you couldn’t be there or weren’t available, you couldn’t join in. But now with so much emphasis and everything going on technology, even if you miss a live session, you can usually get access to a version later on in your own time.
18:29
INT: Of course. And did you decide to use the technology, or not in some instances, because of those advantages or did the advantages tend to become apparent after you started using the technology?
R: A bit of both, to be honest. Obviously, we needed to reach the people and connect with them during a period when we were apart and the technology was one very obvious way of doing that. But, yes, you know with... When someone felt uncomfortable, nobody would push them, but we just thought.. For example, I had a penpal scheme. It sounds so cheesy, but what it was simply, is I had over 130 older people and over 130 children writing letters back and forth to each other. And that’s still going today and many of the people who are a part of it have noted that they don’t want technology support. They wanted a way of communicating but not by technology. So with that scheme, it’s just one example of... technology’s not the answer to everything. And I think that’s sometimes something people forget. People think, ‘Oh, I offer it online. I offer this service now online.’ Well, I think that hybrid or whatever we’re going to call it is more important because, yes, it needs to be online, but also we have to remember the many people who are not online and who do not want to be online. It’s this ‘digital exclusion’ business – that it doesn’t reach everyone. And while it is great, I’m in this generation that’s grown up with it and think it’s brilliant, but it’s not for everyone and we have to respect that and remember that. So, yes, we’ve been making sure we have provision and support for those who aren’t online as well. And I think that’s just as important, perhaps more important at times.
20:39
INT: Yes, that makes complete sense. I’ll come back to that as well, in terms of you foreseeing the use of technology in the future. Before discussing that, I had some questions to ask about how you felt things went, compared to the intention. You’ve mentioned the main ways you use technology... I should first check, were there any examples you wanted to add before I ask about how you think they went or...
R: I don’t think.
INT: OK, you’re putting your hand on...
R: Not that I’m... Perhaps there was something after, but I’m blank at the minute, sorry.
INT: No, no, no. That’s fine. I’ve enjoyed hearing about what you’ve been doing. So, taking those into consideration, generally do you think you succeeded in your aim, or do you consider what you did a success?
21:30
R: Sorry, I have thought of one other project.
INT: Yes?
R: Sorry.
INT: No, it’s fine.
R: We’ve also played a part in a national project – [name of project]. That was a project that started in August 2020. Put simply, the project was to make videos showing what to expect when visiting or re-visiting places because a lot of places look different to how they were before the pandemic. And we heard from talking with many people that they hadn’t been even to their local shops since before the lockdown because of that fear. So we’ve worked with lots of businesses in [name of city] and [name] is the doctor’s name, Dr [name] is leading in the field in Wales. It’s a project that is also the [name of project], which gets that support. So yes, we’ve taken part in that as well and put simply, it’s little things like I went to Specsavers to do a video and just the process of walking through and what to expect – perhaps it could be... Before you could just walk straight in and that was it, but now you had to wait by the door until someone came to you. And then you only sat in the chairs where there were no stickers on them and things like that. So we took part in that project as well. And we’re still taking part to some extent in that project. But we do feel by now that the changes are coming so frequently it needs more than someone doing it on top of their usual work to be able to fulfil it. We’ve still got the original videos up, but at the moment it’s hard to know what will come next in terms of rules. Many places have kept a one-way system in place, so we have videos showing that. But on the other hand, you have shops like supermarkets which have just removed every single rule, and they’re very similar to how they were before Covid. So that as well is technology we’ve kind of taken part in. But, to look at the other side, we had to print these as leaflets as well because many people who were concerned were people who wanted the support visually on paper rather than on a tablet as they didn’t have access to one. But we are aware of some people who’ve been watching the videos before going to places and many of them have been of use to them as well.
24:29
INT: That sounds like a job and a half to keep up, completely updated. That sounds like a really useful service.
R: It was awful because we’d done the Morrisons video and I remember, I obviously shop there anywhere, so we’d done the video and it had been up for a week and I went to Morrisons and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, it’s nothing like it’. So I just deleted the video and I sent them an email, and they just went, “Well, I’m really sorry. Things are going to change weekly, we assume.” And I was like, ‘OK, right’. Yes, I think the idea was great, but perhaps it’s impossible at the time without having a full-time staff member to be able to give the full support.
INT: Yes, that’s very understandable. So to go back to...
R: Sorry.
25:18
INT: No, no, not at all. These questions are more about where you thought the success was greater or less. So do you think you succeeded in your aim, the aim in terms of using digital technology to mitigate isolation during the pandemic?
25:36
R: Yes. So from my personal stand point, my role was to co-ordinate the encouragement group and then from that the online training and handbook came and, rather than creating a training handbook for the individuals receiving the device, for people to be able to give their support. And I think that’s been very successful because all the county’s care home staff have received the training handbook. And even if it only means they are able to give support to people who live in care homes, I think it’s important to remember, although someone lives in a care home, they still can be just as lonely.
26:21
R: We had a grandmother living in a care home – additional care. But she was stuck in her room because of the way they were working. So she was just as lonely as someone living somewhere else. So I think that’s been a big success – that that provision and support has been given – because at the beginning, we wondered ‘Where can we get devices?’ ‘We need this many. We need devices. We need devices.’ But then soon we saw there were devices available everywhere. But we didn’t have the support available and perhaps we also weren’t able, although we could give the support over the phone, because of the pandemic rules and working rules, we weren’t able to go to people’s homes. So by having the support to give to whoever was able to be there, I think that was a huge success. And the hope is... we’ve done the handbook and the training for Apple and Android, but we’ve only used Android to be honest to distribute it. And the main reason for that is because those are the devices that have been available to us. We have the Apple one ready to go, but nobody has asked for it yet. So, yes, the Android one I think has been very worthwhile.
27:44
INT: Thanks. And, do you think... We’re you more successful, perhaps not isolation, with some groups compared to others, do you think?
R: I don’t know. It’s hard to say that. But also it’s hard to know whether it’s the technology that’s lessened the loneliness because very often the individuals who’ve been receiving this support with us through the technology are receiving other support provision from us as well. But from looking at the lady who was able to make contact with family in Spain, she’s one example for certain where it did help reduce loneliness. And perhaps, not as much just loneliness, I think in terms of [name of organisation], they’ve done a lot of research, so I hope they’ll talk with you as well. They’ll have the evidence for you. But I think also not only loneliness in terms of feeling they were by themselves, but feeling, especially with the carers with dementia, they’ve been able to set up a group to support carers. And it’s an opportunity for people to talk about different problems and understand, ‘I’m not by myself with this’. So different to loneliness, that feeling of loneliness, but that loneliness of not having anyone who understands them or understands the challenges they face from day to day. But yes, I think... I don’t know with groups, I’m sorry. I really don’t.
INT: No, no, no problem.
R: So, I’ll try not to answer it.
29:27
INT: No, it was interesting hearing about that distinction between what kind of loneliness can be relevant to people. Along that line somewhat, of those who did use or who engaged with the technology, what do you think they’re main motivation was for doing so and then to continue using it, if they did?
29:48
R: Yes. If we’re talking about the individuals who’ve contacted through the community contacts, many of those wanted to make contact with family. That was the main reason for most of them. But we also had some with an interest in getting connected because they wanted to shop online or wanted to use different services which are available online. But yes... That’s what perhaps made them continue as well because once they understand and see how accessible it is to be able to contact family and so on. But then with [name of organisation] it’s different again because they’ve taken the technology specifically to get access to a service. And to the specific service they were using often before the pandemic as well. So, yes... I think it depends. Community contacts, they were individuals coming forward wanting to get in touch with family or get access to something like online shopping, but with [name of organisation], they wanted access specifically to what [name of organisation] had.
30:59
INT: Thanks, that makes sense. And a question to the contrast, in a way. Were there any users that tried to use the technology before stopping? And if so, do you know why they stopped and what if anything could have helped those people to continue to engage with the service through the technology?
31:18
R: Personally, I don’t, or I don’t have that evidence, sorry.
INT: No, no problem at all.
31:28
INT: I’ll ask this in case, but I assume because it’s on the same theme that there may not be an answer either. If a user had any technological difficulties, what support was given if any?
R: What we did was we... the community connectors gave their phone number – their work phone numbers, obviously – and then if any problems arose, they were able to phone them to have a conversation with them, to be able to talk through that. But I think one problem that arose perhaps before receiving the device or what we did is we would give a device with a SIM card or something like a hotspot and very often, we’d say ‘this is for you to trial it. It doesn’t mean we’re going to take it away from you, but just so we know where we stand because if you don’t use it... And so on.’ But then what a lot of community connectors found is they also had people contacting them saying, ‘Oh, I don’t want to rent. I want to buy.’ So they were then asking for, rather than having a device, asking about advice what device to buy, what device is most user-friendly, what device... and so on. But also the broadband business. That also caused concern for a lot of people. And how to get support in order to have the right broadband. And we had a meeting with some of the [name of organisation] staff because broadband is something very expensive, especially for someone on a pension. And I don’t – this is a personal view, perhaps, not a professional opinion, but again it goes hand in hand with what I do at work – but I do think there should be free broadband for older people who want to have access to the internet because you could argue in a few years it’ll be as essential as water and... Maybe not free, but cheaper and that there’s support there to get it in the home because we were seeing that – some older people saying, ‘Oh yes, I want a device, I want a device.’ but not understanding they needed broadband as well as a device, saying ‘Oh, I’ve got a phone line.’ and not understanding the additional complications. So, yes, that was additional support we were giving perhaps in addition to giving a device. But this initial advice and perhaps there’s no perfect answer either, with that advice either, with what you give.
34:22
INT: That again makes sense in terms of how much support is needed to get it to work. The next question... You’ve talked a bit about this already, but just in case you have more to add... One issue we know is an obstacle for some older people, as you’ve mentioned already, is a fear of using technology either because they don’t want to break devices or because of things like scams on the net. Was that a problem for the older people you’re working with them, and if so what, if anything, were you able to help overcome or avoid these fears?
35:00
R: Yes. The scams I think was one concern. Unfortunately scams take place already over the phone and the fear that it’s going to happen again. With that, we just had to persuade people not to click on anything suspicious. But then when you get a Zoom invitation to something, that’s full of links. It looks scary enough. One piece of advice in the training we had from [name] was to simplify Zoom invitations so that they became familiar what to expect when they had a Zoom invitation – an invitation to our events – so they then knew, ‘Oh, that look... That’s how that looks. But that looks totally different, so I’d better not click on it.’ The community contact also said, ‘Call if you’re suspicious of anything.’ It’s better that they check before clicking than just clicking. So there were many concerns about that. And I think also that people’s families worry about that. Worrying, ‘Oh, no, I don’t want Gran or Mam to get a tablet. What if she clicks the wrong thing or something?’ But I think we have to remember if they only use it to call, share videos and so on, then bank details aren’t going to be near the device. So make sure these personal details just weren’t input at all either. But certainly, it was a concern with families, but it was also a concern with some individuals as well. But it meant some weren’t interested in taking part at all. But others with interest but perhaps more careful with it. But one thing we had as a suggestion as well in the training by [name] was to set the device up for them. So to make sure – to ask them in advance – if we couldn’t be with them – to ask them, ‘what kind of apps do you want on it?’ And then suggest that people then buy the voucher card, say £20 for Google Play or whatever, and then they had something. You know Ancestry.com and so on can cost. So they didn’t feel like they had to give any card details on the device if they want access to anything extra. So, yes, just that advice to be honest, in distributing, but it was still a concern – the scams and losing money and things like that.
37:50
INT: Thanks. So you’re doing many positive things to avoid those fears. What effect did using this technology in this way have on you and your colleagues and the work you do?
R: It was positive in terms of being able to reach people. Again, in terms of my viewpoint, I was coordinating more than offering the services face-to-face online. But I am aware that [name of organisation] have seen it as very positive because they’ve been able to make that important connection with their members. Yes, the positives I’d say on the whole, but you can also argue that it’s tiring. I do know like if I’ve had a day when I’ve been attending some of the events online and then been in meetings for myself and then doing work on my laptop, it is very tiring and you feel that you’re perhaps not getting that break that you need from devices. So from a staff’s perspective, it can also be tiring as well.
39:08
INT: Yes, certainly. And on that theme, there are only a couple of questions left, so I hope you’ll have a break between this and whatever’s bound to be next on your calendar.
R: I’ve got a meeting at 11, so..
INT: Yes. Just two questions to go. Thank you for taking part already. The penultimate one. Were there any unexpected positive or negative effects from using digital technology to mitigate loneliness?
R: I don’t know. Nothing in particular in terms of my work. But I think it is important to note from the perspective that people can still be lonely with access to the internet and connection through the internet. My research shows the most lonely age is the age between 18 and 35 age or between 24 and 35 years old. [name] from [university name] would... She’s done a great deal of research on loneliness and such things, so she could answer that. But the most lonely age is that and then the second most lonely age is over 75 years old. And the younger age group has access to technology. So although it can alleviate loneliness, I don’t think it’s always the perfect answer either because people can still be lonely. Exactly as someone can still be lonely in a room full of people, you know. But, yes. That’s the only thing perhaps I’d... It’s not something unexpected or anything but yes, note that perhaps.
40:54
INT: Yes, that makes complete sense like the nuance in terms of it not being a fix-all or silver bullet.
R: No.
41:00
INT: And the last question. So in your answers in the questionnaire you said you foresee over the next months there’ll be an equal balance between face-to-face support and, you know, the remote support your institution provides. Why is it a combination of face-to-face and remote that you’ve chosen or decided on in terms of looking to the future?
R: Unfortunately at the time, I hadn’t foreseen Omicron coming either. But I think the pandemic is going to change the way we support and work for ever perhaps. I know that sounds completely cheesy, but I think it will because I just think how silly we were sometimes holding events that were only available to people within driving distance or walking distance. When now we can hold things that are open to many more people by doing it online. So I do think the online is going to stay. We have been trialling hybrid meetings. And, yes, trialling, I’d say because we’ve no way understood how to best work them. And those are with staff. So there’s very much work needed to understand how to take advantage of and get the best of both worlds, but I do think that everything has changed a lot and I think it is the best way forward for us now – to understand. Some people are still going to need that technological support. And some people wanting to do face-to-face, we have to ensure the support is available in the two ways. Perhaps 50:50 isn’t correct. Perhaps it would be more 70:30 – 70% face-to-face and 30% by technology. But saying that, I think we’re going to stay something like what we are now for a while as well. So we are limited in terms of what we can do face-to-face for a while, I think.
43:22
INT: Thanks. I feel for you in terms of Omicron scuppering any kind of...
R: I... I’d been... I’ve been one of those positive people, like, ‘right.’. I don’t remember, in September 2020, ‘Ideal, I’ll start this.’ No. Then in September 2021, ‘Great’. And now it’s January 2022 and we’re here again. I must be naive.
43:48
INT: No, it’s worth trying to be positive. I’m sure everyone you work with appreciates that. Just to say thank you very very much for completing the questionnaire and especially for the time you’ve given for the interview. We really appreciate your input in terms of research. Just in terms of the project in general, interviews are taking place through January and February and then the research team will write that all up.
It’s a project between the Wales Centre for Public Policy and Bath University. But if you’re interested in being kept in the loop in terms of when the research is published, we can do that if you’re interested, but only if you want to hear that it’s out.
44:40
R: Well, yes, let me know because as you know, we are working now with eight domains of the World Health Organisation, and the contact and communication is an important part of that, so this clearly plays an important part.
INT: Well, thanks again. I hope you get a bit of a break before the meeting...
R: I’m just going to walk up and down, just to stretch my lets.
INT: Good idea. Lovely meeting you too.
INT: Thanks.





					
Recording Details:		P015 











R1:	So my official title is currently [job tile], and I work for [name of organisation].  We are a local authority trading company solely owned [name of council].  Unique in as much as it’s the first call monitoring assistive technology centre of its kind to act in that way and be a local authority trading company.  Over 30 years’ worth of involvement, not myself, [around a decade] for myself.  Prior to it being [name of organisation] it was [name of other organisation] so has been a call monitoring centre for a very long time. And that’s our core business. So we deal with the reactive actions for people when they’ve got lifelines or any level of monitored assistive technology in their homes.
	[Name of organisation] has been in existence for about three and a half years now, and we have been recently commissioned in the last couple of years to work as the conduit for the transformation fund that we had from Welsh Government or the [name of board] had from Welsh Government through the transformation funding.  And we have rolled out then the [name of project] in line with the business plan that came from that funding.  So that’s who we are I suppose.  We’ve got over 30,000 connections that we deal with across Wales.  So it’s not just in [name of cities], we’ve got other corporate customers across [name of other cities] as well.   
	So quite a big company, and historically have lots of contracts with other local authorities.  That’s tended to be the way it is. So I think there are about seven call monitoring centres across Wales.  We are probably the biggest, close to with another one in [a certain area of] Wales. So lots going on and lots happening.  So we do other things aside from just the call monitoring as well, so the out of hours repair services for housing associations and things like that.  I think we take out of hour calls for Welsh Government as well.  So lots going on.
Int2:	Lots going on, and covering a big area across Wales as well, different parts, so that’s really interesting.  So in the work that you do then, how much focus is there on preventing loneliness and social isolation among people?
R:	So I suppose a little bit of a step back is traditional service provision within assistive technology and lifeline services is very much a reactive service.  We’re sat there waiting for people to press pendants or for sensors to go off, and then the appropriate response will be elicited depending on the circumstances.  What [name of project] actually does is still do that, because obviously there is absolute value in terms of being reactive to people’s circumstances. But the aim of the project really is to be much more proactive and preventative in the approach, and I suppose to work with individuals sooner in their journey into health and social care services. The aim then is to look at those individuals, work with them to create a wellbeing plan that suits them, and one of the focuses is around loneliness and isolation.  
	So we’ve actually got, I’ll say it’s an assessment, it’s not an assessment like you would have anywhere else in terms of some of the statutory service provision.  But very much in line with Welsh legislation and the Social Services Wellbeing Act of what matters conversations and understanding personal circumstances.  Very much about that person centred approach, where their strengths are, what they can do, where their networks are etc. And the whole assessment then at that front end, there’s an algorithm that does it behind it that is unique to ourselves. And actually it drives then priority areas that we can work on with those individuals. So actually if somebody is saying they only see one person a week, as in there’s only their daughter that they might see.  
	They might see that person five, six, seven times a week but actually if that person then, and it’s been very apparent in this pandemic, if that person isn’t able to call to the property they then have not got a network around them.  So I know people think “oh well they’ve got a couple of family members and they see somebody”.  But actually when those networks break down they are then very isolated and unable to achieve probably what they would want to achieve.  So the algorithm that we use and that works in the background actually identifies those.  So although they might not say that they are lonely or isolated depending on frequency of visits, how often, number of people that they’ve got in their networks, actually that allows us to be able to understand that person’s circumstances a little better.
	And what we then tend to work with them on is trying to build those networks.  Whether that be when we can back to some sense of normality people joining in with community groups, encouraging them to join things. And we’ve got a digital element of our delivery where we provide them a tablet, a managed tablet in the first instance because if they’ve not got any digital skills it’s a bit of a scary world giving somebody an open tablet then basically.  But that then hopefully allows them to become digitally engaged, even if it is through things like Facebook groups or social media groups, and encouraging them then to again join online and link with their family and friends remotely as well.
	So everybody sees it as a tech project, which absolutely it is because the technology enabled care that we’re putting in allows us and facilitates us to be able to provide that whole wraparound service that we’ve actually got on the outside of it then really.  And I think that’s the key to the success.  It isn’t actually about putting lots of tech in somebody’s home.  That’s a bespoke assessment.  We make sure that we’ve got the right equipment in, but it’s about that additional wraparound service provision that people actually are then supporting those individuals, stepping in when they’re at crisis point.  Stepping away when they’re not in crisis point.  And this is about building resilience and actually encouraging these individuals to broaden those networks and allow them to be able to be independent and know that they can deal with those situations if it comes up in the future really.
	So again it’s not about stopping people from going into statutory service or stopping people from having care calls or whatever it is.  This is about managing people in the community for as long as possible to remain independent without pushing that demand into a place where it shouldn’t actually be.  So that’s the aim.  And loneliness and isolation is one of the key priority areas, and we link in with pathways that are appropriate to those individuals, and either just signposting.  People are quite resilient and able and capable, we don’t want to take away their independence, but for those that might be a little nervous, might be anxious, haven’t done these things before then we’ll do as much hand holding as we possibly can for them.  And again support them to become confident in being able to deal with these situations.
Int:	That makes sense, and it sounds like it is a drive there and like you say it’s embedded within a bigger approach but it’s definitely a priority.  So you’ve touched on it then but we are really interested in this pandemic experience and what happened there.  So thinking back to the early days of COVID and the first lockdown, what conversations were had in your organisation about how technology might be needed to use differently or more or changed around preventing loneliness?
R:	So we started rolling out the project January 2020, so it was just before the lockdown, it was just kicking off.  And obviously there was quite a lot of nervousness around people going up and having installations, so we found ways around that. So there were some people then that were okay about our officers going out and doing the installations, they’d be in another room, full PPE and all this sort of stuff.  Because actually that would be the only way that those individuals would possibly be able to communicate with people. So it was very much an essential need then for us to continue to do what we needed to do.  Also as part of the project we actually proactively called individuals. So again depending on their assessment and their outcomes they either receive a weekly, monthly or quarterly call standard, and we will flex that depending on personal circumstances.
	And that call then allows that contact. It allows us to understand if there are any significant changes to a person’s circumstances, and also allows us to pick up on some potential triggers for crisis as well. So if that individual says “well I’ve been able to go down to the local shop to do my shopping for the last couple of years, it’s fine, but that shop has now closed”.  That’s the potential for “well okay, how are you going to be managing those things?”  “Can we get you to do it digitally, can we support you to be able to do that?”  “Have you got somebody that can take you to town to do a bigger shop in a bigger supermarket?”  “Are you able to access a taxi service?”  All those sorts of things then really isn’t it?
	So our proactive calls allowed us to then be able to support those individuals, and certainly during lockdown it was unique for everybody.  Nobody had ever experienced any of that had they?  We actually did a significant number of shielding calls for [name of Council], so we did the shielding calls for them.  So anybody that was on the shielding list actually got calls from us as well.  What I would say is that our digital offer we didn’t think was going to be particularly a big percentage of clients that were coming through that would have necessarily ticked the box then I suppose.  But because people weren’t able to get out, people weren’t able to see family members.  We had local lockdowns where from county to county we couldn’t go and see family.
	We probably had a higher uptake with our digital offer than we would have done probably if we weren’t in COVID.  Nothing like a bit of a global pandemic I suppose to actually drive forward some of the work that probably a lot of us in this industry have wanted to do, but you tended to find that there were barriers.  People weren’t comfortable with working remotely or doing things on video.  I find it strange now going into the office and actually sitting in an office with people.  We’ve flipped a little bit haven’t we?  So I think we as a company are very agile and very flexible in the way that we work, and probably have been one of the few transformation funded projects that have actually been able to do what we should have been doing.
	And it’s been very obvious that actually the project and its core ethos around what we should be doing actually has allowed us to be able to support.  I’m just looking at some figures now.  Participant sign-ups, we’ve had over 4,000 clients since January 2020 that have signed up to the project.  So I think what we’ve been able to achieve has been helped a little bit by COVID I suppose.  It sounds very cynical I suppose in terms of that, but that’s the reality of it.  I think it’s pushed people out of comfort zones because it’s had to, and now people are going “well actually I don’t want to go back to doing it that way”.  “This suits me, this is much better for me really”.  So if there is a positive out of it then it’s been that we’ve able to get people to where we probably would have wanted them to have been and be comfortable using the technology in a different way.
Int:	It’s really interesting and it completely makes sense.  It sounds like you were already on that path and then this has almost put it on fast forward because people needed it more than they perhaps would have done.  
R:	I suppose we would have probably been in positions and situations where we would have had to try to twist people’s arms a little bit, and encourage them to give it a go.  Whereas those barriers weren’t there and they were like “well actually that’s the only option I’ve got, and I’m happy to go with it”.  So it’s been helpful.
Int:	I’ve got some questions to ask about the barriers that you’re aware of, and we’ll come onto that.  I’m just wondering, so you mentioned about the tablets and obviously there was the more assistive technology that you were looking at before anyway.  So can you just tell me some more details around the types of technology and the actual hardware/software that you’ve been able to help people to use or you’ve given to them?  
R:	So our standard package, like I said this wasn’t really about doing anything particularly innovative in terms of the equipment that was being used.  So everybody that comes onto the project has a basic lifeline, so a button and a box.  That just allows us to be able to record certain information, understand a person’s demands and the journey that they’re on. So if somebody is pressing their pendant quite a lot there’s clearly lots going on there. So with the facilitator in order for us to do the other work, we do actually offer an assessment. So it’s a bespoke tech package.  So if somebody requires additional sensors, additional support, then obviously they get that within the service delivery.  
	Everybody has a key safe. Now that’s not assistive technology particularly, but we provide a response service as well for clients. And therefore we have to be able to access the property when we get out there. So again there’s some challenges there. People don’t necessarily like key safes, but the reality of it is if you want a response then we have to be able to gain access, otherwise we’re going to be getting the police to break down doors, which we don’t really want to do.  So that was the main crux of it.  Obviously the tablet is a managed tablet so stripped back.  Quite big tiles rather than small little icons.  Making it as simple as possible for people to use with whatever apps they felt appropriate.  Quite a lot of people wanted things like WhatsApp, so the video conferencing options to be able to do what they needed to do with family.
	It also allowed them for that connectivity with GPs or with any health practitioners that they may very well with working with.  At least they’ve got some functionality. I suppose [inaudible 15:45] wearing those systems that were rolled out quite significantly across Wales anyway.  And in addition to that we’ve looked at opportunities to use more I suppose not tracking devices but ones where they’ve got the functionality for GPS to allow people to be able to go out and have a walk around, or to be able to go down and do their shopping etc.  So we’ve looked at some of those options.  The other thing from a client perspective then is where we’re trying to facilitate discharge from hospital as soon as we possibly can.
	Looking at those plug and play options to allow people to be given something that they can take home then, rather than us having to send an engineer out to do an installation and things like that.  So they’ve probably been the main things, but we’ve also been commissioned to roll a telehealth project out, which is again about remote monitoring but of long term conditions.  So things like COPD, diabetes, heart failure.  And our health board has actually commissioned us to do a pilot across the region as well.  And what we’re trying to do is link back there, because invariably they’re going to be similar clients or the same clients that we need to be working with.  And I think longer term we’re going to be looking at trying to use the data that we’d get from there to be even more predictive in understanding when somebody’s potentially going to be hitting the front door for health then I suppose.  
	So lots of opportunities there.  Some [name of company] products as well, so you may have heard of them, [name of country] company. They use a Fitbit to understand frailty.  So again it’s about predictive understanding somebody’s mobility, their gait, whether or not they’re dehydrated, are they up and down to go to the loo and things like that.  And actually that again is another algorithm that [name of company] have got behind that to understand if there’s a decline for somebody let’s step in a little bit earlier and actually support them.  Possibly check if they’ve got a UTI, possibly check if they’re not as mobile as they were what’s going on there, and actually hopefully prevent some of those falls then.  
Int:	That’s really interesting, I’ve not heard of that before.  So you mentioned then especially around the tablets and thinking about the loneliness and isolation.  So if people were particularly wanting that video calling, that communication side of things.  So was that more successful for some groups of people compared to others rolling that out?  What differences were there in the groups?
R:	I think we did have some people perhaps that had already had a simple basic smartphone and had some ability in terms of being able to utilise the equipment.  Huge differences between people’s ability.  So given the fact that also we couldn’t spend lots of time sitting with them and telling them how to use it, and showing them how to use it, we found that that was quite a big resource intensive side of it, is trying to support individuals.  So we’ve linked quite a lot with our third sector groups locally.  So Age Cymru for us have digital buddies who’ve been able to try and do some phone conversations.  A lot of what we try to do is to see whether or not we could have a family member who they would be linking with at the installation so we could talk them through how to do it.  
	So again ensuring that those individuals had a network of support around them where they could use it.  But quite broad really.  Some of those people would get it straightaway and were able to do it.  We had people that had I suppose early dementia, not early dementia diagnosis but possibly dementia diagnosis.  I’ll give an example here because it’s quite comical from our perspective in terms of understanding it, but the reality is it was a frustration for the individual.  And actually unless you’re there you don’t necessarily know what it is that they’re saying.  My grandparents are no longer with us, but if I said to my grandmother “press the enter button”.  That doesn’t mean anything at all to them.
	So it’s about having the right conversation as well and understanding you’ve really sometimes got to take it down very basic.  But we had a client with an early dementia diagnosis, so very early on in that journey really, had always had an iPad function so was okay with them and things like that.  But at the time we didn’t know, they’d taken it out of the case, a robust case around it just to make sure that it’s protected, but had put the tablet back in the wrong way.  So none of the buttons were obviously lining up where things were, but she thought that it was working because on the back of our tablets we’ve got a [name of organisation] sticker.  So she thought she was looking at a [name of organisation] screen and couldn’t understand why it wasn’t working at all.
	And it was only when the daughter went there and actually looked said “it’s actually round the wrong way”.  There was nothing wrong with it, it’s just that it had been put back the wrong way.  Why she needed to take it out of the case we don’t know, but that’s the reality of what we’re talking about here.  So quite a challenge if we’re being honest, and probably within the confines of the project we didn’t have the resource there to actually be able to support those individuals in the way that we would have wanted to really.  And that’s been quite a bit of learning for us.  The stronger bit for us is about the installation, the initial support, the systems and the infrastructure around those things.  Whereas I think our third sector colleagues or people that are actually in the community are probably better placed to be able to provide that ongoing support and learning for individuals.
Int:	Like you say it’s different resources isn’t it, different pockets of expertise, and that comes to light as that goes on.  And so there’s people obviously then within the groups you’ve helped where they might take to it differently or they might come across different problems.  But were there any people where you maybe suggested technology as a way to reduce loneliness or isolation and they didn’t want to engage with it, or maybe they did initially and then stopped?  What was going on for those people?
R:	So because it’s a managed tablet we’re able to understand usage.  So we do tend to tap back in.  So when we do the proactive calls we ask them whether or not they’re getting involved in the tablets, whether they want to.  And there are some people that are just not interested in it and cannot take to it.  And that’s fine, we can’t force anybody to do anything.  We just make sure then that those wellbeing calls that we’re doing and the proactive calls are actually supporting.  And it goes back to our community wellbeing officers then to understand that this person doesn’t want to engage with that technology, and then they look and review their wellbeing plan to understand what other things can possibly be put in place.  
	And it might be things like I suppose your befriending services, so they know that they’ve got somebody that they can talk to regularly aside from our wellbeing calls.  It might be that we increase the wellbeing calls.  If they were a monthly client and they had the tablet, then that would have been perhaps okay.  But we might switch them to a weekly call so we can just keep touching base with them really.  So varying degrees of success across the board, and that’s the case I think with any technology isn’t it?  Some things suit, some things don’t.  The three local authorities that we work with have obviously got quite strong third sector groups, so where we can we link them back that way.  And it might be that a tablet that isn’t locked down might be more appropriate.  
	So those groups may very well have little groups that they’ve already set up and find a way to work with them. So we look at all possibilities and sometimes it’s a bit trial and error but you’ve got to try it first to see whether or not it’s going to work.  
Int:	That’s like you said before about how this situation perhaps prompted more people to try it when maybe they wouldn’t have, but it’s not always going to be a one size fits all is it?  
R:	No, not at all.
Int:	One of the things that we know is a barrier for some older adults is a fear of using technology maybe from not wanting to break it or being afraid of scams and things.  Was that an issue for the people that you were working with, and what could you do to overcome some of that if it was a problem?
R:	Like I’ve already said I think we struggled early doors within the lockdown period, because we couldn’t physically go in and support individuals.  We did our best to try and provide some online, so if we could talk them through to be able to show them some videos and things.  So we set up a video process to show people how to use things.  It was about trying to connect with family members and see whether or not they could get there, and again about that support mechanism.  We’re open 24/7 so I suppose if somebody really had a problem they would be pressing their pendants and they’d come through to us and they would let us know.  And we would do our best then to try to be able to support them with their queries and concerns.  
	But I think on the whole we’ve just tried to support where we can, and like I said if it really isn’t working then there’s no point in trying to push down that route, and just find other mechanisms for individuals to interact I suppose.  I think the managed device has allowed us to be able to try things quite quickly with individuals.  So we can upload different apps and push things through quite quickly remotely, so it doesn’t require us to go back out and do something, which has been helpful.  I can’t quite remember where I was going with this conversation, what were you asking?
Int:	It was about the fact that we know about people being afraid about scams and things, and if that came up.  
R:	Scams is a good one. That was the one that I wanted to say about. So because it is a managed system we made it quite clear to those individuals that actually if somebody tries to get through on those things. So we have had a couple of occasions when individuals were contacted, told by the person on the phone “well if you log into your computer now”.  “Have you got one?”  “Yes”.  “Right, go onto a Google search and type this in”. They’ve gone and done that and it’s blocked it, so they haven’t been able to be scammed then really.  So I think for us knowing that that managed device has actually got all of those backups there has meant that we’ve actually been able to stop people from being in those vulnerable positions really.  
	We’ve actually set up a couple of virtual groups for the local authority.  So one is a learning disabilities group.  So they have yoga sessions, bingo sessions, karaoke sessions that they do via Teams.  But it allows those individuals as well to be quite independent on the tablet but actually within a protected bubble.  So I know that’s been really helpful, and the feedback that we’ve had from family members is that they know that they can allow their child, and I say adult child as well to actually go on to websites that probably if they only had their own ones they would be quite concerned.  I’m the same now, I’ve got a six year old and an 11 year old, we’re like hawks watching what they’re going on because they haven’t got managed device, well semi-managed because we’ve got a family link back to me.
	But they can go onto YouTube, they can go onto certain TikTok videos, all these sorts of things.  And you’re just like “oh”.  But at least there was a way to control that to a degree I suppose for a lot of them.  And the same for our older individuals.  And the other group that we’ve got is a day centre group.  So when the day centre was closed we’ve been able to link those groups back up, so they’re able to see the people that they would have been talking to and chatting with and things on a regular basis. So again having the managed system I think offers a level of protection that people are comfortable with, and certainly family members are comfortable with as well, knowing that mum and dad are not going to be able to enter their bank details and have all their life savings taken from them.  
Int:	That’s exactly it yeah.  
R:	Actually on the technology point of view we are working with our Trading Standards Company and we’ve got a call blocker system that we actually install on behalf of Trading Standards, where it actually stops any potential scam phone calls going through.  So actually again that’s another piece of technology that we’re actually putting in again to try and protect individuals as much as we can.
Int:	That sounds like something that would be really useful.  And I suppose you mentioned in there about having family involved and having that as a real priority.  So it’s an interesting one because I suppose perhaps people who are more lonely and more isolated maybe don’t have the family around, but then the family also can be when people do that it’s a key reason why they want to engage and want to communicate.  So did you find differences between who didn’t have family around to start with, and then people who have more?  How do you navigate that differently with the technology?
R:	I suppose the challenge we had with people that actually had lots of family around, it was probably during the height of COVID when we were in lockdown it was quite easy to get people to want to engage with that technology side of it, because they wanted to be able to communicate with people.  And where there were family members but might have lived away, again fairly simple I suppose and easy to encourage people to do that.  So I know we had a couple of older clients that were obviously locked down, nobody could visit from another town or even across in England and things like this.  And we were able to provide them with a tablet and they got to see their first great grandchild through video link and things like that.  
	That’s immense isn’t it really?  It’s quite a dramatic statement but we’ve changed people’s lives by them being able to now have WhatsApp groups that they wouldn’t have been part of previously.  So they get to see what’s going on in their family’s lives on a regular basis, even outside of COVID and lockdown.  We’ve got family members that are living in Canada and Australia.  These people didn’t have a phone, they didn’t have a tablet or anything, but now they can video call on a regular basis.  They can have those photos sent through to them and communicate.  We had one family that didn’t have a clue that their mum loved opera.  And one of the apps that she asked for or put on or whatever allowed her to do it.  And they were like “this is a whole side of mum that we knew nothing at all about”.  
	But again I think it’s allowed for that interaction and a different level of involvement with families a little bit.  Those perhaps that didn’t have family around probably were more open to trying to engage with certain groups.  But again I think they were quite anxious about it, and I suppose for some there was definitely a step too far because they just were like “I can’t do anything like that”.  And again we would try to look at other mechanisms to support that individual through something that suited them, I suppose phone calls and perhaps socially distanced activities and things like that.  We worked quite a lot with our local library services to be able to encourage people to have an online presence to be able to at least link in with books and magazines and subscriptions, learn a new language and all sorts of things.
	And our mobile library as well.  So actually when the mobile library was going out and about they were letting them know about the digital side of things.  Because there were occasions when that mobile library couldn’t go and do what it was needed to do as well.  So I think there are always going to be individuals that we can’t support from a tech perspective, but then it’s essential for us not to get too carried away with ourselves in terms of the technology and digital world, and still remember that we’ve got other people that are actually not in the position to be able to do that.  And I think in Wales we’ve still got some challenges with regards to broadband connectivity issues and goodness knows what.  
	Our tablet is provided with the internet, so we’ve got SIM based 4G connectivity and things like that.  We’ve also got routers for those where perhaps the wireless doesn’t work as well.  But we still have challenges where that’s been a struggle even in some of those black spots where we can’t get connectivity.  So it’s just about making sure that it’s not “right, well that doesn’t work therefore we can’t help you”.  It’s “that doesn’t work, let’s look at other ways to be able to support you in a different way, and perhaps in a more traditional way when we can”.  Or they might come up with ideas themselves.  Sometimes you’ve got to go with it really, and this is about encouraging that asset based approach.  What can you do?  What do you want to do?  
	We haven’t gone as far as allowing people to do parachute jumps and goodness knows what, but again if people want to be doing these things.  If they’ve got a bucket list let’s help them to achieve what they want to want to achieve.
Int:	And so when you did the survey for us you said that obviously beforehand you were doing equal face to face and then the remote, and it sounds like now we’ve spoken it’s because you were rolling out this new project but it was only early days still.  So how do you see things going forward in the future in terms of the balance between face to face and remote services that you might offer?
R:	It’s never going to go back, absolutely won’t go back.  I think there’s too many people that actually like the ability to do the remote.  Our installation teams are still going out and obviously having to do that.  There’s a physical requirement for us to do that.  Our community wellbeing officers, the original plan when we did the assessments was for them to go out and have eyes on and be able to understand what’s going on.  Because it’s amazing how many people tell you certain things down a phone that are not quite right, and I think eyes on sometimes allows you to have a different conversation.  Where we can we will go out and do those assessments.  Obviously with people that have got certain impairments, so visual impairments or hearing impairments, that would still be the way that we would run those things.
	But again it’s back to what suits the individual.  If we’ve got somebody that wants to see us then we go and we do those calls, we do those visits.  If there are people that want to go to groups and that’s what they want to do, then that will be part of their wellbeing plan.  That’s what they want to do. So again very much around outcomes from an individual’s perspective as opposed to what we think they should be doing.  And all we can do is guide them and offer advice then really in terms of what’s out there, what’s available.  There are lots of people that want to continue to do things that we know is going to be of detriment to them.  There’s nothing we can do about it.  We’re talking about adults that have got capacity, it is what it is and all we can do is support them where we can really.
	But I can’t see anybody going back to the way it was.  There’s been a wholesale change in the way that we all work I think.  And for service providers and delivery of anything there has to be several options of how that is delivered.  There has to be now I think, and rightly so.  We should be able to support individuals in the way that they want to be supported.  
Int:	And it sounds like from your experience then the offer that you’ve got you can be quite confident in that as well because of the things that have gone well and the things that are on offer.  So looking forwards it sounds like that can be quite a confident plan.  Again I think there was a couple of mentions in the survey about the evaluation side of things, but do you plan to do any formal evaluation of how loneliness and social isolation with your service users or clients has been affected by technology that you’ve used?
R:	So obviously because it is transformation grant funding there has to be an evaluation, and that’s being done by [name of evaluating organisation] I think locally for us.  So it’s being driven by the [name of board] so we’re just providing whatever we get asked for in terms of that.  I’ve recently spoken to a colleague in the [name of organisation] which is the governing body the assistive technology that we are certified with about carrying out some evaluation specifically for us though in terms of understanding how we’ve impacted and what we’ve done.  Because I think Welsh Government’s outcomes are probably different than what we would probably want to identify as outcomes, not identify but what we would want to be able to understand from what we’re doing.  
	So it’s something that we’re keen to do because I think being able to share that learning, and for people to understand where the benefits are from doing these things.  We want to be able to share our successes, but we also want to make sure that people don’t make the same mistakes.  Because the bottom line is new project, new service delivery, we’ve made mistakes absolutely.  We’ve had the theory and then it’s not worked like that in practice, which is always the case isn’t it?  And I think we’re just lucky enough that we’ve got a dedicated and committed workforce who are able to be agile and flexible and do what they need to do.  Understand the values of doing the right thing for the individual, and working within the confines of our legislation.  
	Obviously don’t do things that you shouldn’t be doing.  But actually allowing clients to push the boundaries a little bit as well.  That’s what they want to do.  Like I said we can’t stop people from doing things if that’s what they want to do.  But I think some of that positive risk taking is very beneficial, because actually I’ve always said it’s the Dr Pepper scenario isn’t it?  What’s the worst that can happen?  And I think as long as you’re working safely and making sure that you’re working within the confines of law generally, you shouldn’t be doing anything wrong anyway.  So I think evaluation is key for anything anyway.  Understanding where we’re adding value, understanding the potential to do something slightly differently, and understanding what impact we’ve been able to have on individuals is quite strong.
	We’ve generated an assessment tool, very much like an outcomes star is the basis for it.  And there are six domains that we actually ask people to score themselves on at the baseline point when they first join.  And then we do a six month review currently just to make sure that things are actually okay and people are happy with the service.  And we look at then improved, maintained or decreased scores.  I think our last one we did we were hitting around the 80% that have either maintained or improved their scores across all six domains.  Now I know people think perhaps “maintained, that’s not very good”.  But people maintaining their score during a global pandemic and are still comfortable and happy and feel they’re getting the right help and are still fairly positive, that’s phenomenal.  
	Because actually people’s wellbeing has been significantly impacted through this pandemic, and people that wouldn’t even have thought about their own wellbeing previously have gone “actually yeah, this has been quite a challenge hasn’t it?”  And I think if we’re saying that we’ve maintained and improved 80% of our clients’ scores then that’s phenomenal I think in terms of our outcomes for individuals.  There are obvious dips in some scores.  I think one of the domains is doing things that count.  When people can’t get out and do the things that they would normally do, then obviously that’s going to be an area that will be thingy.  But actually having the right help has increased quite a bit, because actually that means that we are supporting them to get what they need I think.  So it’s quite interesting looking at that, and I think that evaluation will be really key in terms of understand the impact that we’ve had for individuals.
Int:	Definitely, it sounds like you’ve got the scope for that in there as well so that’s really good.  Well that’s pretty much all of my questions.  [section removed for confidentiality, interviewer talks about reaching older adults]
R:	Yeah, we collar our clients quite regularly.  We’ve had to do it for evaluation things, so we’re registered.  Our response team are also registered for [name of organisation], to provide care and support.  We [are] also registered as a response service.  [section removed for confidentiality]
Int:	Thank you.  Well that’s pretty much everything from me, so was there anything else you wanted to share or any other comments?
R:	No, it’s fine.  I’m always happy to talk about [name of project], it seems to be my life at the moment.  I’ve got a webinar I think the week after next with [name of organisation] and all sorts of stuff going on.  So hopefully my voice will be okay by then and I don’t have to struggle through it.  Happy to help and if there are any other queries or questions then just come back to me.
Int:	Thank you so much, I really appreciate you taking the time today especially when you’re not 100%.  Lovely to meet you, bye.
R:	And you, bye.
[CLOSE]











					
Recording Details:		P014













Int:	To start, could you please give me a brief overview of your role and of the organisation that you work for?
R:	I work for [name of organisation], but they house the role. The role is that of a [job title], and a [job title] is a unique way of working that originated in [name of country] over 30 years ago. It’s a model of working in a strength-based, person-centred way, that ultimately seeks to walk alongside people and identify their vision of a good life, and support them to achieve that. 
	At this moment in time, I’m standing in for the [job title], so supporting the running of the team, but my main employment is as a [job title], and that’s a place-based area specific role, and I happen to have the [name of area].
Int:	OK. Could you tell me about the work that your organisation does with older people specifically?
R:	We get what we call introductions, because we’re very precious – for want of a better word, about language, so people aren’t referred to us, people are introduced to us. We go along without badges, or a specific dress sense, and meet people as human to human in a setting of their choosing, which could be their home, or in a local café, or in the community. We then work with these individuals on a one-to-one basis. 60 percent of our time is spent on a one-to-one basis, 20 percent is on community capacity building, then 20 percent of our time’s taken up on admin and these kind of things, meetings. 
Int:	Do you work with other populations than just older adults?
R:	Yep, we work from cradle to grave, so anybody can be introduced to local area co-ordination, and we receive introductions from everything from schools – whether it’s around the children or the parents, GP surgeries for patients, social services for people perhaps who don’t quite fall into the category requiring a care provision, mental health workers, health in general, elected representatives. Sometimes some of the best introductions we have are from people themselves. Because we’re community-based we have what we call bumping stops within communities, so we’re often to be seen in cafes, or community centres, and people will come up to us and say, “Alright, someone’s told me about me and the work you do, can we have a chat?” Then we’ll progress, get to know them. 
	With us, the important thing is the conversation and the relationship. We get to know the person, we get to know their situation, we work to build trust, we work to understand what is going on around them, then try to understand and see their vision of a good life. There’s no time limits on our work, we dip in and dip out of people’s lives as necessary. A very simple analogy is we are afforded the luxury and the privilege of being invited into people’s lives, and a little bit like a car journey, they’re the driver and we’re occasionally afforded the luxury and privilege of sitting in the back seat from time to time on their journey of life. 
Int:	Fantastic, that’s a great metaphor. How much focus would you say is there on preventing loneliness and social isolation within these introductions you have?
R:	I would say that is a large part of why the role exists. It’s about social connection, finding meaningful opportunities, supporting people on their general health and wellbeing. An inordinate number of studies have shown that social isolation is detrimental to physical and mental health and overall wellbeing. It’s certainly not the only reason people introduce us, but a large part of our work is combating and mitigating isolation.
	For a number of reasons it could be someone’s relocated an area, someone that’s had a relationship breakdown, someone who’s simply lost their job or had a health upset in their lives. Funnily enough this week we liaised with the Traumatic Brain Injury Service in [name of hospital]. People who have head injuries for example, or stroke, medical incident, that’s life changing and can leave people very lonely and isolated. By virtue of a medical condition could easily lose their home, their relationships, their income, so a lot of our work is spent on re-connecting people to community, to meaningful activities, and to possibly volunteering work. Building a life I would say. 
Int:	So do you link those people to other existing organisations within your community?
R:	At times yes. We’re afforded the opportunity to facilitate and catalyse natural introductions that would happen. Say for example if you were standing in a queue in Tesco and you were having a chat to someone, and you suddenly hit it off and they said, “Oh, do you fancy a cuppa and a catch up after this?” and suddenly a friendship will develop. Or you went to a gym and you bumped in to someone, or you went to somewhere and you see someone regularly, and you suddenly find you’ve got something in common. 
	We can actually utilise such methods. We make sure that the introduction is appropriate, but by way of example, I have been introduced to people with similar interests previously, singing, and said, “Well you know, there’s a little group of gals [sounds like 0:06:44.3] together with a bit of music at a certain time, do you fancy coming along?” I’d say that to both of them individually, meet them there, introduce them there, and then how that relationship progresses is entirely up to them. 
	We consider this role a skilled generalist role, because there’s an element of coaching, motivation, counselling, advocacy, direct work, it’s pretty endless really. By getting to know people, knowing them in their circumstances, you have a good understanding of them and what is a good fit. Of course if you’re doing that with a number of people, the fits just shine like a light really, and you create the circumstances where these can then come together, and if it works, that’s great, and if it doesn’t there’s no pressure, we move on to something else. But I have to say, in many, many occasions it works, and it’s lovely. It’s quite emotional to tell you the truth, it’s almost like magic, it’s really difficult to explain. 
Int:	Intangible? 
R:	Yeah, and after this funnily enough, if I remember I’ll send you a little story that I shared recently. We evidence our work with the true stories, because as you say, it is quite intangible, so whereas historically it’s bean counters tend to make decisions don’t they? You’ve got a situation and you’ve got a quantifiable output, so how many people you’ve seen, for how long, how long you’ve worked with them, what were the results? It just doesn’t fit our way of working, because for example, I’ve worked with someone for five years, not constantly and every week, but initially quite intensely, I’ll tell you the story. There was an older gentleman, he’d been married for over 60 years, his wife had sadly advanced dementia and was placed into a nursing home. He was absolutely distraught, and practically suicidal. He went to see the doctor, he wasn’t coping, he was given some anti-depressants and he was in a real slump. 
	I was introduced to him by the doctor, went along, had a chat with him. Through meetings with tears and cups of tea, understood the situation, understood the loss, explained to him a different way of thinking about dementia – and I’m sure you know this, but with dementia a very simple explanation is you’ve got two bookcases. The one on the left is your emotions and that’s rock solid, so you’ve got happiness and sadness and anxiety and all these things. That’s rock solid, that doesn’t move. On the right you’ve got your memories, with the newest ones on the top, and that’s really rocky. So the new ones fall off, and you’ve got the old ones so you can remember how to use a gas cooker and light a candle, depending on how far back you go! But people put electric kettle on a gas ring, because the notion of electric’s gone. These older memories are rock solid. 
	The point I was alluding to is if you take someone out for an ice-cream and give them a nice time, they’re in a lovely, happy, relaxed state, but they might not even know why, because that memory’s gone already. The value is in doing that to keep them in a good state, and when I explained that to him, again he burst in to tears and could see a value then, because he couldn’t understand the value in visiting his wife, who just didn’t recognise him anymore. To explain to him that his presence and doing nice things with her would relieve her anxiousness and her upset and her inner-struggles, it was like a cathartic release for him. He continued then to visit her, had value in that. It turned out he wrote wonderful poetry, had a connection [sounds like 0:11:36.3] with a publisher, he had a book published of his poetry, continued to write poetry and they were five years on. 
	He’s actually in hospital at this moment in time, his wife sadly passed away around this time last year and his health is deteriorating, however he is 86. He’s had five productive years where he’s engaged with his family, he’s had a book published, he’s come along to community events, he’s a bit of a local celebrity, he’s given a poetry recital in front of an audience. That wasn’t a possibility five years ago when he was in tears and actively thinking of ending his own life. That’s [inaudible 0:12:21.1] often always the case, but who else could have done that? Anybody could, but nobody does, and that’s where we sit. 
Int:	That’s fascinating and touching work you guys do. It sounds like a lot of it is face-to-face contingent. If you think back to the early days of COVID-19, what sorts of conversations were had in your organisation about how digital technology could be used to prevent loneliness and social isolation? 
R:	Interesting, this is why I was interested in the survey. Prior to COVID hitting, I had identified a number of older males within the community who were certainly taking up a lot of my time. Our job is not to create a dependency, because there’s only one of us, so it’s very much a conduit to a life, the doorway to friendships, community. I was working with a number of men, who all had something in common, so I simply invited them all to a café on a Friday morning, and jokingly called it the 11 o’clock club, and they started coming along, and it just by word of mouth just grew and grew and grew, to the point that I think we had way over a dozen coming on a Friday morning to the café, having a coffee and a catch up and a laugh. What started out as two or three people meeting for half an hour, has become a whole Friday morning until even half past one, two o’clock. Just people dipping in and dipping out as they want, and catching up. The poet I spoke to would drop in. 
	It was working really well. Come the pandemic it had to stop, so the consideration was it was of such value to people, and they benefited through it, could we do it virtually? So I engaged with [name] actually, one of the educators from [name of organisation], and they afforded us a platform where we could virtually put a coffee morning on. And that’s what we did. Some people didn’t have access to IT equipment, so it was a case of sourcing IT equipment, and rapidly upskilling them that they could utilise that, or making for one person who didn’t have internet, just making a room available where he could come by himself and access a laptop and set that up for him. It was a huge success. It ran right through lockdown, people kept connected. 
	The model worked so well, we tried it out in other areas as well, and it was a success. That was relevant and useful, there isn’t anybody who will say virtual or IT is as good as in person – I’d be very surprised, but it’s convenient, it’s like us now, if we’ve had to travel to see each other it’d have taken a day just to do this. Everyone can see the benefits, but it’s not human is it? As a stop gap it’s great, but I think people are really looking forward to going back to the in-person meeting. 
Int:	When you were discussing implementing this technology – it sounds like it was a video conferencing platform that you used for the coffee morning? What did you think were the pros and cons of using technology? I know you said lack of human contact as a con, but is there anything else that comes to mind?
R:	Yeah, very much so. The mental and physical aptitude of the older generation to use information technology. A huge barrier. A lot do not have broadband, internet connection, a lot simply do not have the laptop or the tablet, or a smart phone, so the lack of equipment to actually do it. I’m way older than you, I grew up pre-computers. Not pre their invention! But pre their commonplace use, so when I left school – my sister was two years younger than me, I think it was her year was the first to have computer science as a subject. There were no computers in school when I was in school. Oh my goodness, looking back to it, I’ve worked now for over 40 years, I think the first mobile phone I ever had in work was in something like 1995? At that time I was on the cutting edge of national law enforcement, it was 1995 before we had a mobile phone. The generation we’re talking to – I’m [over 50 years old], are 30 years older than me again, so the clunkiness I sometimes find with computers and information technology, you can imagine when perhaps your sight isn’t as good as it was, your hearing isn’t as good as it was, your manual dexterity to operate it isn’t as good as it was, your capacity to understand simple functions and menus to go through, because they simply don’t have either the speed of thought or the short term memory to navigate through a menu. 
	You’ve got the physical barriers, the not owning and the not having, and then you’ve got the person capacity barriers to not being able to and not familiar with. Some simply don’t want, they’re frightened of it, they miss the old days when life was simpler, they’d rather do things in person, they’d rather do things over the phone. I have to say, even at my age I’ll text my children or anybody and keep in touch, given them a call, but I don’t think to video call them. I don’t think to, because yes, we use Teams now, and that’s more and more, but very often in work I will e-mail as opposed to video call, when a quick video call would suffice and save time. 
	You’re of a generation you’ve grown up with technology, so it’s natural, and I think there’s a speed of thought. I look at my children, and they whip through screens – I haven’t even seen the screen! And they’re already five ahead and I’m thinking of the one they’ve just seen. There is that inherent divide between I think the ones who were brought up digitally, and the ones who weren’t, and the ones who have the capacity to learn and adapt, and the ones who’ve got reduced capacity to learn and adapt, and then a reduced functioning capacity, which exacerbates things. 
Int:	Do you have other examples of ways digital technology was used in your organisation to reduce loneliness – apart from the coffee morning and the video conferencing?
R:	Texting. There were occasionally some video calls, but less of. Oh, food shopping, supporting people to do some food shopping online. The surgery went over to online prescriptions, so people could order prescriptions online rather than going in person or ringing. It’s creeping in slowly I think with things. And social media of course was quite big, to capture volunteers, so people were interested in supporting the community, disseminating information around the pandemic and what was happening, and co-ordinating community response to need. Social media as well was useful, but again, only for the ones who are connected. 
	We all think social media is the answer, but the very people who are connected on social media often haven’t got the need – because they’re already connected on social media! So it tends to suggest, not always of course, but they’ve got the financial ability to have social media, which means they’ve got the technology and the ability to pay for it, they’ve got the intelligence and the educational savvy to operate it, which often suggests they’re managing in other ways as well. It’s not always the case, but the ones who really aren’t managing are the ones who aren’t on social media, and those are the ones often that we need to try and get in touch with. 
Int:	Would you say that overall you achieved your goal of reducing loneliness by using technology during the pandemic?
R:	No. I think it mitigated on occasion some of the issues, but I would say no. I think technology is far less user-friendly for people who have difficulties with technology. For example, if there was – and arguably with Alexa now and smart TVs as these things are moving, albeit the difficulty and the costs and the set up.  If you think of a simple tablet that was voice-controlled and you could switch on, and operate it from that, like we see in futuristic films where there’s suddenly a person on the wall, and I’m talking to a person on the wall because I’ve just called you up or something, you can see the value in that with someone who is struggling. A lot of people haven’t got the hand dexterity, they’ve got arthritis, they haven’t got the vision capacity to see screens, unless they’re 65 inches big. I think technology lets down the lesser able, because of its usability, in my humble opinion. 
Int:	For those who actually did engage with the technology, what you do think was their motivation to do so, and to keep engaging with it?
R:	Because by virtue of the 11 o’clock club I think the relationship was already there and they wanted to maintain that relationship. I think that was a big driver, not to lose that beacon of light really I suppose. A lot of people I work with, the 11 o’clock club on a Friday is a high point in their lives, and sometimes we forget. I don’t know what your life is now, but I should imagine at your age and what you’re doing, you’ve got a busy life. If your life was sat in that room, seven days a week, with no conversation with anybody, but one day a week you could gather with a few like-minded friends and have a chat, and feel understood and have a laugh, that would be huge. 
	A lot of these people we work with are actually prisoners in their own home. Albeit not physically, but because they’ve got a lack of mobility or they’ve stopped driving, or the transport situation across the country now is pretty dire, the physical capacity to go out and about, the emotional and mental capacity to engage and strike up new friendships or feel of worth, a lot of that has gone which creates loneliness and isolation. These physical things that people can access easily, in person, human touch, we forget how important that is. If you haven’t had a hug from someone in a while, it’s a bit sad. We forget that, don’t we? We live in an age where, “Oh, mustn’t touch!” But actually it’s lovely to have a hug, isn’t it? I’d go along to these groups and the older women, they’d all come up and give me a kiss, pre-COVID. How lovely is that? I go to see my gran. My gran’s 106 and she lives in a nursing home now, I’m going to pop to see her. Even thought it’s COVID I’ll hold her hand and just give her a hug, because who else does? It’s huge, isn’t it? I think we forget the value of these, so as much as IT is a useful tool – and it is, nobody can get away from it, speed of communication, it doesn’t replace the human touch, another human presence.
Int:	Yeah, I agree, it’s completely different. You’ve mentioned groups of people who engage with technology, those who are left out of it. Have you witnessed any who started using technology, but then stopped? And if so, do you know why they stopped?
R:	There’s one person in particular, and I think it was just because it was just all too much. He springs to mind, and even my mum. My mum is going to be 80 this year, and she’s, “I’ve used computers in work.” She retired 20 years ago! “I don’t want anything to do with them now.” And she’d rather my sister do her online shopping for her, and me do the shopping for her, than actually do it herself. I think there is an element isn’t there, of as we get older – and I don’t know if you know this, forgive me if you do, but dementia’s very often diagnosed way later than it started. So there’s a decline in cognitive function way before diagnosis, and people say, “Oh you know, it’s quite normal to forget things, I’m sure you forget things now?” I’m actually a brain injury survivor, so I’ve got an excuse for forgetting things, but aside from that, everybody forgets things. Dementia isn’t only memory loss, and people always say, “It’s just memory loss.” No it isn’t, it’s the slow death of the brain. All things go, and there’s no rhyme or reason as to what goes. 
	The point I’m getting at is, sometimes the ability to thrive, the motivation is destroyed or reduced, so people are unmotivated. I don’t know if any studies – I’m sure they have been, what’s linked to depression and isolation, and they’re intrinsically linked, of course they are, a stimulated brain is a more active brain. The point I’m getting at that it’s just too much for some people. The effort sometimes to live, is enough effort in itself. To get up in the morning, to make a cup of tea, to struggle through the day, that’s enough in itself. Their energy levels have dropped. 
	It has to be a holistic approach. A lot of the time I meet people and I say when we’re having a chat, “What do you do about cooking?” and they’re, “Oh, I cook and I do things,” “Oh OK, what do you have for breakfast then?” “Oh tea and toast.” “Ah right, OK, so what’re you having for dinner?” “Oh, I’ll have biscuit now and a cup of tea.” “Oh OK, so what do you have for tea then?” “Oh, I’ll have tea and toast.” And you suddenly realise that they’re actually living on tea and toast, or tea and biscuits. That is going to reduce their mental capacity, their physical capacity, their mood, which in turn reduces the will. They’re isolated as well, so it’s not one size fits all or one fix. 
	That’s where we often come in, I call it the keepers of life, if people are eating right, sleeping right, exercising within their capacity, got a stable roof over their heads, got income coming in to fund that life, then you can do something with that person if they want. 
Int:	It all interacts. 
R:	It all interacts, it’s all intrinsically linked. To give someone IT and connect them up, but they’re eating toast and tea, it’s got to come before that hasn’t it? I suppose that’s where we sit, is in the whole person approach as to how can we support this person to be stronger, more connected, feel of worth the time [sounds like 0:31:53.0]. And supporting their whole being. 
Int:	If service users had any technical problems, was your organisation able to provide any support for that?
R:	Yeah, and interestingly, that’s a really good point. We call people, people. Not service users! Because they’re people. Don’t think that’s a criticism, but I wouldn’t want to be called a service user. Do you see what I mean?
Int:	I get what you’re saying. 
R:	I have used services, it’s funny, isn’t it? The people we work with, yes, we’ve had some really good support from the council. The [name of project] team happy to pick up, talk through people. Because we are place based, I’ve got connections within the community to have people go along and give them a hand to get the computer up and running, or things up and running. That’s something we consciously look to support with solutions for. 
Int:	One thing we know is that sometimes what can be a barrier for some older adults, is the fear of using technology, either due to not wanting to break, or afraid of internet scams and things like that. Is that an issue for some of the older adults you worked with?
R:	Yes, without a doubt.
Int:	How did you help them overcome these fears?
R:	Previously we’ve done some scams awareness training. I think it was HSBC and our own [officers]. We give a little bit of training and input on scams awareness, and we delivered that to groups locally. For example pre-pandemic, just in my area, there was about 50 older adults going to [place] on a Monday afternoon. We had a presentation there. We’ve got about 50 much the same adults going to an exercise falls prevention class on a Tuesday afternoon, delivery there. We’ve got [name of lunch club], where again, around 50 – not always the same 50. U3A – University of Third Age. There’s about four large groups of older adults within the areas I serve.
	Prior to the pandemic we had various speakers in, just trying to promote a little bit of confidence around IT and making them aware of scams. Other than individual chats  - and we would post and circle it, where we were aware of scams during COVID, there was no specific one-to-one intervention on that subject. Am I answering expansive enough, or too much for you? Is this OK for you?
Int:	This is perfect, you’re giving a lot of examples and answering my questions, it’s lovely, it’s exactly what we need. You mentioned some positives and negative effects of using digital technology to address loneliness and social isolation, were there any unexpected ones that you hadn’t thought about when installing it? 
R:	I would say on occasion the fear and a refusal to try. You’d think, “Well you know go on, give it a go then, just see what happens.” We had the opportunity via the [name of organisation] for Voluntary Services for funded smart phones that we could give to members of the community who weren’t digitally connected. You’d think the offer of a free smart phone for at least a year, would be a good offer. If I said, “You can have this for free, for a year, and you haven’t got to do anything. Every month you’ll have a code just to pop in, and that’ll top it up and that’s it.” The amount of no’s were surprising to me. 
	The problem is it’s unfamiliar, so it becomes suspicious, the fact that it’s unfamiliar. Yes there’s probably in the back of the mind the worry of scams or what could go wrong – which you often find with older adults with IT, “If I push that button I’ll break it.” Just the fear of causing a problem. A little bit of people just become sadly disabled, or disenabled. They just don’t want, and it’s far easier to have someone else do it for them, and having worked with a lot of older people, sometimes that is the real barrier, they don’t want to change. There’s a lack of appetite to change. Not all, I wouldn’t make such a sweeping statement for everybody, but very often there’s a lack of appetite to change, a lack of appetite to learn new things, it’s frightening, it’s scary, they’ve heard some things about it which they’re not too sure of, so leave well alone just in case. 
	By way of example, we’ve got an older woman living in the town, early 90s, 92 or 3, probably 4 by now, no heating. Last year was found on the floor and the temperate inside the house was something like two degrees I think. Refused, absolutely refuses support or to put heating on, or financially able to put heating on, just won’t spend the money. Offered a phone, the phone it’s an ongoing challenge, it’s been given, been given back, given, given back! Some quite difficult situations, which require some real gentle management. As it is there’s some volunteers working around this woman and doing some amazing, amazing things. 
	It’s a tough one as a society, how do we help people who perhaps need the help but don’t recognise it themselves? This the rub, it often falls in the Social Service and Wellbeing Act Wales, where people are entitled to voice, choice and control, and so they should be. They should certainly have that, but there’s that fine line between do we go in and judge, which isn’t person-centred and shouldn’t be done, but if you go and see someone who’s – as I have worked with previously, literally elderly, a gentlemen in his 90s, blind, actually blind, catheterised, living in a shack [sounds like 0:39:56.8]. How’s that OK? But at what point do you say, “Well you can’t live like that either?” That’s a choice, has capacity, is at war with the world and wants to do that. How do you then best support them? The answer very often is just bit by bit, and wherever you can. 
Int:	It’s true they have to be willing to accept the help, you can’t force it on them. 
R:	And who are we to judge? You live a certain way and I live a certain way, and maybe how I live wouldn’t suit you and vice versa. It’s a real difficult one, isn’t it? Where is the, “It’s not OK?” There’s certain situations if you think about, that we would remove children from the situation because we’d say it’s not OK, and yet older adults can stay in there, in similar circumstances. It’s a real tough one, isn’t it?
Int:	It’s a tricky balance! In your survey response you said that you anticipated the balance of face-to-face and remote support in your organisation to be mostly face-to-face in the future? Why have you not decided to go with a blend of face-to-face and remote?
R:	Because from my experience at least, there’s nothing that can replace human contact, for the very reasons we’ve said. The nuances of conversation, of human interaction, the understanding that someone’s actually interested in you, that they’re physically looking you in the eye when they’re talking to you. That actual presence is a far warmer, more human connection I think. Because we work so much with that, anything less is a dilution perhaps of how we work, and I think I can say would most certainly dilute our results. 
	We’ve looked at things like telephone trees [sounds like 0:42:17.5], it’s looking for the best possible outcome for each situation. If you’ve got someone for example, who is housebound, well it’s quite possible that human connection physically, is far more difficult. Whereas you could have two people housebound, and you could connect them digitally or by telephone, and they could have a relationship, which might not be as good as physically present, but it could be the next best thing. There I see some of the value in supporting our workers, is where it’s the next best thing. Just as a side, what we don’t condone I suppose, or encourage, is befriending, because if you think about it, how demeaning is that, to have to pay to have friends? It’s something not right about it, isn’t it, if you think about it? A befriending service, with the best will in the world, and as lovely as it is, it actually sort of says that I haven’t got any friends and I want someone to be my professional friend. Isn’t it better to try and instigate natural friendships that create a relationship of equity, of sharing, of mutual respect, who can support each other? Which has got longevity because very often a befriending service and then they get a different job, that’s a friendly professional, isn’t it? It’s not a friend. 
Int:	Yeah, you want long-term connections. 
R:	Yeah, so I think that’s where we constantly are looking, is what we can do to support meaningful changes in people’s lives. 
Int:	Fantastic, thank you for your answers. [section removed for confidentiality] Perfect, thank you very much. I hope you have a lovely day. 
R:	And you, tata now. 
Int:	Bye.

Recording Details:		P013













Int:	To start could you please give a brief overview of your role and of the organisation that you work for?
R:	Yeah. So my name is [xxxx]. I’m [job title] of [name of organisation]. We are a regional organisation that support people with a sensory loss and actually wider people with a disability in [area of] Wales. Our core clients are people with a hearing loss, although we do have services specifically for people with a visual impairment and for PAM [sounds like 00:00:38] disability equipment advice and information. We have been established for [several decades]. We started off when there was a change in the unitary authorities of [area of] Wales and deaf people felt that their needs would get lost in the mix so, actually, we are an organisation that was built by our core customer. Does that work? 
Int:	That’s perfect. Very interesting. Could you tell me about the work that your organisation does specifically with older people?
R:	The majority of people who are older will have an acquired hearing loss. They are the biggest group that we work with. We have information advice services. We have accessible health services which is supporting people with a hearing loss to deal with their own medical appointments. We also have something called [name of project] which is supporting people to live better with an acquired hearing loss later in life. That will be sign posting, it’s befriending. It’s information around technologies that can be used to help them stay independent within their own home. 
Int:	How does your work with older people differ with your work with other populations?
R:	We tend to find that younger people are quite mobile phone savvy, video calling savvy, sending text messages. Quite happy to turn a computer on. Not all of them, I’m not generalising here because we do come across older people who are extremely digitally included. The majority of people though, because we’re also in quite a rural area where internet speeds are not very good so we do find that they are quite hesitant to try new things with regards to technology. So whereas we can go in to an older person and we can put something on their phone which means when their phone rings a little pager will vibrant or a light will flash. They don’t see that as technology, quite happy to use that. The minute we pull out a tablet and they go, “Oh, no, I don’t want one of them.” 
	So that’s where it’s different. Whereas when we do go and see younger people and we’ll say, “You can control this. You can get this new hearing aid that you can control off a smartphone and you can attach it to a smartphone,” that’s all fine. With older people they tend to be more reticent and they like more, I suppose, things they can touch and see as opposed to this all works wirelessly and it goes to the cloud. So that’s the biggest difference that we see.  
Int:	How much focus is there on preventing loneliness and social isolation within your organisation?
R:	So our [name of project] is specifically aimed at those people for whom a hearing loss is causing the beginning of that isolation because what happens is when someone has a hearing loss they start to withdraw from society so pre-pandemic they may have gone fishing with a friend, they may have been part of a book club. They may have just liked to go to the pub on a Friday and a Saturday. As communication becomes an issue they do tend to withdraw. Part of our [name of project] is befriending. It’s two-pronged. We have [name of project] which is very much one to one. It may be that we visit somebody, send them a letter. We’ve brought back pen pals. It may be we give them a call. If they are tech savvy, we’ll do a video call with them. 
	Then there’s also [name of project] and that’s to encourage people to get back out into the community. It could be just going with them and sitting in a café for a little while so they can get that usual thing of when you live in a village you go and sit in the café and suddenly everyone you know is in the café. Or even some things like taking them back and going with them back to groups and things like that and using technologies to help them communicate so making sure room loops are working so that when they do go to these clubs they can hear what’s being said. So very much around that technology and things like that about getting people back into their community. 
Int:	That’s fantastic. If you could think back to the early days of covid-19 what sorts of conversations were had in your organisation about how digital technology could or should be used to prevent loneliness and social isolation? 
R:	The biggest impact we had when covid started, the local deaf group would meet in our office. They have a coffee morning every week which was where the older deaf community would come together and they’d sit, have a cup of coffee, have a chat in their own language because they were all BSL users, so communication wasn’t an issue and everything was fine. 
	We had to close shop like everyone else and it was how we could facilitate those people still meeting and so we did some work with the committee around using video calling because obviously that happened and Zoom was very, very popular already amongst some deaf people because they use video technologies to communicate with each other. It was how we could utilise that to be more inclusive so that [inaudible 00:07:09] Tuesday morning would actually sit in their own homes and have their cup of tea with their friend and still have a conversation with them through sign language. 
	Actually, that continued. So when lockdown was eased and community centres were able to open what we did then was that we actually facilitated the deaf club being back in the office but we had a big screen on the wall and we made sure that the Zoom account was open so that people who didn’t feel confident to actually come back face to face could still join in with the coffee morning.  
Int:	You were saying that some individuals were already using Zoom as a way to communicate. Was your organisation using it before Covid as well?
R:	We were. We were using Zoom at that time, Teams. Because we have staff here, there and everywhere, so we have outreach workers and we would have team meetings and we would use initially Teams but then we discovered that when you have that many people on that Teams was a little bit jerky so we looked around and we’d found Zoom and we were already using that for staff meetings. 
Int:	The change from pre-covid to after covid was just an increase in the use of video software, yeah?
R:	It was. Then we also, as I said with our befriending service, is that we had to look at what we could do that way and rather than use technology what we did was took a step back and we started the letter writing. We bought tablets, we bought mobile phones that we could loan to people through the pandemic so that we could do digital inclusion work with them. They could text message and things. Nothing took off like the letter writing thing did. 
Int:	What did you and your colleagues think were the pros and cons of using technology to prevent loneliness at the beginning of this conversation?
R:	The technology worked really, really well for people who were happy to engage with it. A bit like anything. We were very reliant on people, their friends and family being able to set things up for them because we weren’t able to go out and do that for them. We created some how to guides on how to use Skype and Zoom and WhatsApp and all of these. We created lots and lots of materials that were accessible to people for them to have a look at. We were quite reliant on there being somebody at the other end to help set that up. 
	The pandemic, I think, for those people who were already digitally excluded, they unfortunately moved further away because whereas they may have been able to go to their library and someone in the library would have helped them on the laptops in the library, computers in the library, suddenly they had nowhere else to go. It’s a bit like our service, we can’t phone somebody who can’t use a phone when the reason we need to phone them is that they can’t use a phone. So if people were digitally excluded, we couldn’t use digital methods to contact them to teach them how to use the digital methods that they needed to use for us to contact them.  
Int:	A vicious circle. 
R:	It is a vicious circle and then added to that is we may have been able to phone somebody and take them through step by step but if we’re using technologies because they can’t hear on the phone then we’ve got another hurdle in the way. So the people who were able to engage with technologies, fine. We would text, they’d text us. We’d video call. They’d video call each other. People were able to set up little groups and they’d have their Friday night quizzes and things, but for those people who were digitally excluded it was very, very difficult to do anything, hence the “Let’s go back to old fashioned pen and paper.” Which in a way is a technology, isn’t it? A pen is a piece of technology it’s just something that you don’t plug in. 
Int:	It’s true. Is there any tech that you’ve previously tried that hadn’t worked?
R:	Not really. The stuff that we’ve used has been quite tried and tested with our customer base and with our colleagues, to be fair. We haven’t downloaded or bought a piece of kit and suddenly found actually it’s a waste of time, other than of course those tablets and mobile phones that older people just didn’t want to interact with, but that’s more hardware than a new piece of technology. 
Int:	You’ve already discussed this a bit but can you tell me in some more detail the main ways digital technology was used in your organisation to address social isolation, so what was done, why, with whom, how often?
R:	We facilitated the deaf club on a weekly basis. You usually get about between eight and 12 people who would regularly meet through Zoom there and it was just an opportunity for people to have a chat, share information. Talk about issues that they had because of covid. Ask each other the questions. Ask us questions. All of our services were accessible through video calling, through text messaging, through email, through making a phone call. Anything that didn’t mean they came to our front door we had things in place for people to be able to contact us. That was done on a daily basis. 
	We had a bespoke covid information and advice service that answered over 1000 calls in something like the first 10 months of the pandemic. That was people contacting us, us contacting people to check they were okay but mostly people contacting us because they had concerns about whether they were allowed to go out, who they could see when they could go out. When it went to you could have a support bubble, we explained what a support bubble was for people. We have a media team. 
	We have a filming suite here and we utilised that to make videos to show people, to explain to people what they could do so that people were aware that actually you can meet one of your friends now. Six of you can go out and meet and have a cup of tea, that sort of thing. Those videos were viewed over 58,000 times. Now, there’s not 58,000 British Sign Language users living in [area of] Wales. There’s probably not 58,000 people with a hearing loss living in [area of] Wales. So they had a much wider reach than we were expecting. 
	That was some technologies that we utilised. That’s really it. Because of the nature of our customers, we had already set up a lot of the remote access anyway for profoundly deaf people. Someone who lives effectively 30 miles away, it could take an hour and a half for someone to go 30 miles in [area of] Wales so there’s no way someone who lives 30 miles away who’s got one letter is going to traipse all the way over here to see us so we already had a lot of digital inclusion and remote access to the services anyway. 
	I suppose it was just expanding that so looking at different platforms. I mean pre-pandemic I don’t think I’d ever heard of Signal but now everyone seems to be using Signal for one reason or another. There’s lots of different things like that. So it wasn’t huge changes for us it was just, I think, the amount of people who were actually utilising it that changed for us. I’m not sure that actually answered your question at all. 
Int:	No, you did. You gave me lots of details so it’s exactly what I need. Would you say that overall you achieved your goal of reducing loneliness and social isolation?
R:	I think we did. I think during the pandemic there was that concern that people who were already isolated would become even more isolated. So when you’ve got a group of people who could only communicate with a very small other group of people, so people who use British Sign Language couldn’t really converse with neighbours, people turning up to deliver their food from Asda, absolutely no communication at all. So for them it was vital that they had someone that they could talk to in their chosen language that they could understand what was being said. Whether it was me telling them what the stripes on the floor of Tesco was for to make sure you were staying two meters away or whether they were phoning to go, “Oh my goodness, it’s pouring here today.” 
	People had that opportunity to contact us and I think for some of our members we were the only people they talked to on a weekly basis. So I do think that we achieved our aims, however, for all of that we do know that there were plenty of other people who unfortunately didn’t have that opportunity. 
Int:	Do you think it was more successful at reducing loneliness and social isolation for some groups compared to others?
R:	As I said before, very much so. People who were already digitally included, people who were quite happy to use a mobile phone, whether that was for video calling or text messaging, people who were quite happy to send an email, I think for them it worked really well. For those people who found technology quite frightening or they lived somewhere where there was no mobile signal at all and where effectively they were still on some form of dial up because the internet speeds were so bad, I think for them it didn’t work particularly well. I go back to hence we used the technology of a pen. 
Int:	So just here you briefly mentioned some people might have been frightened so we know that one issue usually as a barrier for some older adults is the fear of using technology, either due to not wanting to break it or scared of scams, things like that. So it sounds like it might have been an issue for some older adults you work with and so was there anything to help overcome these fears?
R:	Well, [name] who was our [name of project] advisor was really good because obviously a lot of technologies that we used were to enable people to, so for example, putting an amplifier on the phone, giving them a new phone that had amplification on it, making sure they knew the phone was ringing. [Name] was very, very good at putting people at ease when it came to using stuff like that. She would phone the neighbours. She’d phone children. She’d phone the carers. Through them was then able to get the phone set up and then have a conversation. Sometimes the first time in years that someone with a hearing loss has picked the phone up and had a conversation with somebody. I’ve lost my train of thought. What was the question? 
Int:	The fear of using technology. 
R:	The fear, yeah. So for them and the technologies that we put in like that they’re quite robust, they look robust. Whereas if you’re talking about someone suddenly using a mobile phone, a smartphone or a laptop or a tablet, it’s quite flimsy. It feels like it would break quite easily. So for them when we were introducing things like that there was that hesitancy, there was that little bit of fear and I think some people will never get over that until the time we can go and sit there and drop it on the floor and pick it up and go, “Look, it still works.” I suppose it depends on the technology that we’re talking about. Some of it, I think we can get over that fear by simply saying, “If it breaks social services will give you a new one,” as opposed to, “If it breaks you have to pay £200.” It’s like anything, isn’t it? If there are no consequences, you’ll feel much more confident about trying something out. 
Int:	That’s very true. Were there any service users that you saw that tried to use any type of technology you were suggesting but then stopped?
R:	Yeah, so we did have a couple that at the beginning we would talk about, strangely enough, text messaging and using a mobile phone and to start with would use that, that wasn’t a problem. Then I think for a myriad of reasons suddenly decided that the mobile phone wasn’t working properly. The mobile phone was working properly it’s just that they had forgotten how to use it and then as we were talking to them it transpired that actually they were losing some of their capability and their understanding. They went back to effectively using a laptop which is something that they could do but only to use Skype. We went from emailing and text messaging where they could take a picture of their letter they didn’t understand or they’d send us photographs to suddenly going back to them using Skype and holding a letter up and doing this so we could sort of see what it says. 
	That was quite difficult and quite distressing for both us and for them actually, although to this day they still believe that the issue was with the mobile phone, which is fine. If it’s quite settling for them then that’s fine. That was the only one really. Everyone else who had a little bit of knowledge, they seemed quite happy to carry on. To be fair, using Zoom, what have you, they’re actually quite straightforward if you don’t touch any of the settings. So it’s click on that blue line there and you’re automatically in the meeting. We were quite fortunate it was just that one person and I don’t think that was anything to do with the pandemic. I think maybe it sped things up but I think that was something else. 
Int:	If your service users encountered any technical problems, what kind of support was provided? I know you said there was a YouTube video to help install the thing. Could they reach you?
R:	Yeah, but also they could give us a call and we would run through things with them, that wasn’t a problem. I think [name] spent hours upon hours upon hours talking people through setting up new phones, new doorbells, how to turn things on and off. We were quite reachable by other means. 
Int:	What effect did using technology in this way have on you and your colleagues and the work you do?
R:	Well, to start with, we were able to continue to do our work. The pandemic hit and everything was able to continue, including our [name of project] that unfortunately started on April 1st. Just as we were going into lockdown is just when that new project was starting, but we managed to do everything that we needed to do. We were able to all work from home and yet still feel like we were connected. So we’d be sitting at our desks with Teams running on another screen and all of a sudden somebody would go, “Oh my God, did you see so and so last night?” So our colleagues were still able to have those general chit chat conversations while we were working. It meant that we were able to help more people. So, as I said, 58,000 views of our videos when we thought maybe 50 people might get something out of them. We were able to reach more people in less time which meant that effectively that pressure of, “Oh my God, we’re under covid,” it didn’t really impact on our jobs. We were able to just be colleagues.
Int:	That’s lovely. So you’ve mentioned some positive and negative effects of using digital technology to address loneliness. Were there any that were unexpected positive and unexpected negative effects that you hadn’t foreseen?
R:	I suppose positives were the people that we didn’t really expect to take to the technology to just take to the technology. That was really nice. All of a sudden you’d get this call from someone and you’d think, “We’ve not spoken to you in probably two years before the pandemic, you’ve not been here, and suddenly, oh my God, there you are.” So it was nice to see some of our old faces. Some had moved away. Some were busy. But actually it did give an opportunity for someone to go, “Oh, I’m just going to give [xxxx] a call.” So that was nice in the fact that our scope increased. Our scope, our reach, how people could reach us. We weren’t quite so insular as we had been before so that was lovely. 
	Negatively, we were reachable. That sounds a little bit fully but it became constant. So you’d walk into the office in the morning and the mobile phone would be red hot and there’d be 30 or 40 messages on it because people are texting through the night because they can text through the night now. So it was a bit like this, but hey, it’s not a negative to be busy unless you’re the person who has to do all the work which is not me anymore so I’m quite happy.  
Int:	In your survey response you said that you anticipate the balance of face to face and remote support your organisation provides in the future to be an equal balance of both and so why do you think you’ve decided to go with a blended approach?
R:	Because I think again, I mean number one it’s good for the environment. We’re not having to send somebody an hour and a half down the road to deal with something to send them an hour and a half back again. Our interpreting service, lots of people now are used to using interpreters via a screen, so I foresee that’s going to continue. For example, for a medical appointment if someone’s going for a flu jab, they don’t need to have an interpreter booked for a three-hour session for someone who’s going to walk in, get jabbed and get out again. Whereas what they can do is have their mobile phone, the interpreter is signing what’s being said, they have their jab, they go, they turn it off. So I foresee the interpreting being very different. There will always be call for face to face interpreting, always. Specifically with some of the more in depth medical appointments. But for your general community interpreting, I foresee that being very much people used to seeing an interpreter on the screen now. 
	I think with some of those short-term interventions, so have a drop in session, I think that will always be face to face. People like to have an appointment. They like to come in. The coffee morning will continue to be face to face but with that digital option as well, which also means again that people who live far away can now contribute to that coffee morning as well. I just think that that blended approach, there will always be those people who need face to face interaction but I do think it’s going to be more settled. I do think it’s going to be a 50/50 split. If anything, it may tip over more to be digital and less face to face. People are less confident at going out now. I think it’s just a question of wait and see what happens but I do think it’s going to be maybe half and half. I don’t think we’ll ever stop using digital technologies and things like that. That will continue forever.  
Int:	What do you think would be needed to make using this blended approach successful for your service users in your organisation?
R:	I think once things are more settled people feel better about it, I think. I know there was a time when everyone was offering digital inclusion including the people who come and clean your bins. Everyone and their brother was offering digital inclusion but there were still those people for whom being excluded was just the norm. I’ve said before, there are areas of [part of] Wales where you can’t get a mobile signal. There are areas of [part of] Wales where the internet connection is rubbish. 
	I do think there needs to be some one-to-one digital inclusion maybe hidden or something else because sometimes I think digital inclusion, even the name can put people off. Maybe it’s one of those things whereby when our at home advisor goes out to talk to some of these very isolated people who’ve got hearing loss is finding a way of then following that up with some digital inclusion but there has to be a buy in from them and I think sometimes that’s the barrier. The barrier is, “I don’t trust technology so I’m quite happy here. I’m quite happy being by myself.” So it’s how you, or how we find a way of getting round that.
Int:	Do you plan to do any type of formal evaluation of loneliness of your service users and the technology they’re using?
R:	We don’t have any plans to do anything formal like that, no. 
Int:	If I may ask, how come? 
R:	Just because I think it’s something that we’ve not really thought about. We obviously have our [name of project], digital technologies, depending on what you mean by digital technologies. So if you’re talking about smartphones and laptops and tablets, what have you, not so much. If you’re talking about the technologies that we go in and put in that maybe are things like making the phone louder through a digital hearing aid, if it’s a TV streamer then, yes, we do always follow those up because our [name of project] is evaluated externally, evaluated by [name of evaluating company] and they will be looking at that. So specifically that project will be but our other projects will not be.

Recording Details:		P012











 
R:	I’m technically known as [job title] for one psychiatric nursing home in [name of city] and one residential care home for people living with dementia in [name of city]. That means I don’t particularly get involved in the operational stuff but more on the strategic, high-level supervision of the management, etc. 
Int:	Are they separate homes in different places then?	
R:	They are separate homes about 25 miles apart, yes. 
Int:	We’re specifically looking at older adults so can you tell me about the work that your organisation does with older people specifically?
R:	Yeah. What are you defining as old, by the way, in terms of age?
Int:	I think we’re going more on what the organisation goes by. 
R:	Right, okay. We don’t define particularly old but our dementia care home is obviously mainly older. We have a couple of early onset but still reasonably old going up to I think 97 is our oldest resident. There’s up to 25 residents there at any one time. In the midst of the pandemic there was actually a step-down facility so that means getting people outside of hospital into [name of care home], into the care home. They would spend anything from a few days to a few weeks rehabilitating and waiting for service packages or getting assessed to go home or to a nursing home or whatever. We dealt with a lot of old people including a lot of turnover of those but now for the last sort of year very much our standard, it’s a care home for elderly mainly living with dementia but obviously the dementia takes priority so we would have people in their late fifties. 
Int:	That makes sense. So within that generally then, how much focus is there on preventing loneliness and social isolation with your clients?
R:	Well, it’s an interesting one, isn’t it? I’d say the move to a care home is one of the significant factors to stop that, isn’t it? In a way? Especially with dementia, obviously in a pandemic it’s been horrendous for people out there who are at home in a very, very isolated way maybe with one carer who’s a husband or a wife and that was an incredibly hard time for that little household. A lot of the time our old residents at [name of care home] have been coming into us having met a crisis point at home so I’d say at least maybe three quarters of residents that we’ve had there now in our permanent model have come from home. One of the key, I suppose messages isn’t the right word, but one of the key benefits is that actually a lot of that goes away, doesn’t it, really?
Int:	Yeah. So what you’re saying is just by being there it’s almost started to address that isolation because they’re automatically less isolated. 
R:	Absolutely. So that’s a good thing. There have also been a lot of negative things, obviously, hasn’t there? Being in a care home in a pandemic at times, not now, thank God, but previously we’ve had quite a lot of times where there’s either been, okay for a limited amount of times that there’s been no visiting or extremely limited visiting, extremely restricted visiting and that has massive challenges, especially for people living with dementia. 
Int:	Yeah, definitely. Thinking back then to those early days of the pandemic when those restrictions were in place, what sorts of conversations were had in your organisation about how maybe digital technology might be used to prevent loneliness? 
R:	Lots and lots and lots. I think we did very well with it. The good thing is that we use Teams already so this is good, so there is a level of reasonable competence in some of the staff with digital technology generally. The options we had were things like Teams, Zoom, even FaceTime on people’s phones, etc. That sort of thing. We were very limited to using digital technology to drive the contact with families. That was good in the fact that that was there and available but the problem is just fundamentally that does not cut it very well with a lot of people living with dementia because they just don’t understand it. You can have a lot of support but you would have people not really engaging because, like this, you look like someone on the telly so you don’t understand that that might be your family member or you don’t recognise it as your family member, or very distressed or very confused by it. “Well why are you on the telly?” sort of thing. There is a lot of that. 
	We were actually really massively surprised as well that a lot of people really lived it, so that’s great. We had quite good conversations and funny conversations and people having a bit of a laugh about the fact they were on telly and so there was actually quite a lot of benefit from that but there was also, I’d say, a very, very big handful, even maybe more, a third maybe, who just couldn’t engage with it. Very, very supportive it was just not for them. They might have a couple of seconds and then just want to stop it. 
Int:	No, that makes complete sense. Were those issues things that you could foresee that you thought might happen?
R:	Yes, absolutely, but at the time you’re very limited to what you can do so it’s always worth having a go with the communication because other communication forms were really, really basic where it’s like through a window. I mean that’s horrendous, isn’t it? With a family member sat outside in the rain with an umbrella with a phone speaking to their mum or their dad or their partner on the phone with no understanding. It was okay, don’t get me wrong. It was better than nothing a lot of the time but it was also incredibly distressing for people on both sides, sometimes to the extent that you just think is that really worth it? So it was difficult. 
Int:	You mention that obviously you’d been using Teams and things so the staff were quite confident but had you ever been using digital technology for the clients before the pandemic?
R:	Yeah. I suppose [name of care home] is a bit of a tricky one because the care home we’re talking about here actually only opened as a result of the pandemic. That opened in April 2020 so I can’t really say anything on that one. With the psychiatric nursing home in [name of city], even though there’s adults from 18 onwards there are actually quite a lot of older adults there and we’ve had that for 30 odd years there. Definitely they have used absolutely technology previous to pandemic anyway. Not a lot but quite handy to have people joining in on a Zoom birthday party because their niece is in [name of city], that sort of thing. So it’s not completely abnormal. 
Int:	Yeah, so there’s been a place for that there but then it obviously just really ramped up. 
R:	More pressure on it, yeah. 
Int:	I had a look at the survey that you’ve done for us as well and you mentioned that you’d been able to provide tablets or iPads and things like that, so can you just tell me a bit more details about the actual devices and the types of technology you were using?
R:	It’s a variety. We have laptops and we bought more laptops with big screens like the one I’m on now, so the HP 15” screen so essentially to make that big. We already had a couple of iPads floating about. The Welsh Government did a scheme like a digital inclusion scheme and they lent us I think at least two iPads through that scheme which was great and I think we had that for at least a year, which was helpful. We also allowed the senior staff who’ve got the company mobile phones, quite honestly to use mobile phones, because that’s the problem sometimes with Facebook and FaceTime. I’m never a fan of FaceTime but I also appreciate that a lot of our families use FaceTime as their normal thing so they would have to FaceTime privately with our manager who’s also on Facebook and do it that way on a little phone. So that’s difficult. We also now use little Samsung Galaxy tablet or something like that. Those sorts of things which are sightly smaller. On the whole I would say it was the iPads that we were using for that. 
Int:	You’ve mentioned then and it would be quite interesting to go into that a bit more about the different people who did really engage with it and it went really well and then the people perhaps where it didn’t go quite so well. You said the dementia was the key factor. Were there any other groups where it was better for some and not so good for others? Were there any similarities between the people where they felt different effects?
R:	Yeah. This is just me putting into it but obviously being an older group of people their families, including sons and daughters, they’re pretty old and definitely husbands and wives are old and a lot of them, maybe even the majority of them, when we were saying, “Can you send us your Skype user ID?” Had no idea, had never done things like that. I wonder whether the ones that who are more successful in it have at least had some history in the family of using that, or maybe the families were more natural. It’s difficult to pinpoint it. With dementia communication is difficult anyway, isn’t it?
Int:	No, that makes sense and that’s really interesting so actually for the client or the service user that you have it’s almost not entirely how they’re finding it, it’s also how the family are finding it. 
R:	Oh, definitely.  Also, the time that we had to spend on the phone doing bloody IT support, quite honestly, for families, was massive and very, very tricky and very challenging. 
Int:	That was one of my questions anyway actually was to ask about how you came across any technical difficulties or support that was provided. What kinds of things were happening with that?
R:	A typical example is that the iPads from the Welsh Government were set up with Skype, that was the usual thing. That’s okay. I use Skype at work every now and again and that’s fine but I wouldn’t think Skype is the social media communication of choice, I don’t think, is it? It’s probably a bit more business, isn’t it, I suppose? A lot of our families were having to set up Skype on laptops and phones and things like that. We don’t have a Facebook. It’s tricky, we were probably a bit behind the schedule in not having Facebook and we still don’t have Facebook for ourselves. Because Skype was there for the preferred route, the easiest route because you just go ‘call, Skype’ on the iPads for staff and it meant a lot of pressure on friends and family, well families, to do Skype at home, etc. They would often phone because we’d say, “It works with us to book a time, so like 11 o’clock, and we’ll try and Skype you,” and then you’d spend at least 20 minutes more Skyping them, phoning them, them phoning you saying they can’t figure it out. All of the usual palaver from digital anything, isn’t it? In a very stressful time. That was very challenging and frustrating for all parties, of course it was. There wasn’t really an awful lot of things we could do on that but it was definitely telephone support and thankfully we added on extra admin staff which we obviously paid for to literally just be there to be able to spend 20 minutes on the phone with Mr [name] walking him through how to put Skype on his mobile.
Int:	I was going to ask because thinking of your situation in a care home and you must be so incredibly busy that that as an added factor, how did you cope with that? So you actually had the ability to get some extra staff to help. 
R:	Yeah, we did. We were lucky/planned, which is we have an admin team that works sort of centrally. For the two homes they dip in and out of admin, etc, so they can use that admin team. That admin team was made up of two people, one full time, one part time. We ended up increasing the contract of the part time one to effectively full time plus adding a third one on. This is a significant cost in order just to boost up the numbers of people available to help with communication. We kept that going because actually that’s really helpful because actually in the health setting now we’re under huge pressure with staffing and self-isolation, so actually those pressures have carried on they’re just different now. It still helps at least having someone to be able to chat on the phone to someone, not about Skype necessarily but just about anything really to allow that contact to be felt. 
Int:	The residents that you have that were keen to engage and keen to keep going with the technology, what do you think was their motivation around that?
R:	They were not keen at all. Remember our residents, our clientele, fabulous as they are, they will be quite advanced with dementia. It’s very much something that’s driven by us as a service rather than them saying anything about setting up a Skype. 
Int:	So it was more, “Let’s have a go at this,” rather than, “Can I have a go?”
R:	Yeah. There was absolutely no driver from any of them. I can’t remember a single time. When you would just launch upon them, so you wouldn’t even tell them, often we would get me, another staff member, whoever, to faff around with Skype and then literally once you’re up, great, fine, walk it through to the resident, surprise. That seemed to work. It sounds awful, doesn’t it, but for lots of them that seemed to work best of all because that was a lovely surprise. 
Int:	Yeah. No, it does make sense and, like you say, sometimes that bit beforehand with all the setting it up, I mean that’s just confusing in itself. 
R:	Very stressful. That’s obviously for families but our people would have been very connected, in their previous lives would have been quite connected into certain community things. A church put on Zoom services. Great. So we thought that would work really well. That was almost a complete disaster because you’re joining on Zoom and you put it on the big telly and that’s great, so that was quite good because it looks a little bit just like you’re watching a church service on the telly so that’s okay. What was very, very difficult was that church service was finding the communication, the digital technologies hard themselves so you’d have, “You’ve got your mic on,” blah, blah. That’s just distracting, confusing. Don’t really understand it. Frustrating. So that didn’t ever really work either and it was maybe a bit too distant so we had to abandon that which was a bit of a shame. Again, there was nothing really out there specifically for dementia where it would be really clear, calm, simple, easy to follow, that the sound was really good. Things like that really matter. 
Int:	I suppose you were almost thrown in a situation where you don’t know that until you’ve had to try it first and then see.
R:	You have to try things, don’t you? You have to try things. Also, when we were in step down it wasn’t necessarily that everyone had dementia, not at all, because it was a step down [inaudible 00:17:34]. I think over time we had something like 60 something people come through the system in about 12 months. That puts a massive amount of pressure on the system to do communications for all of those different people and to keep them engaged with social stuff, which is virtually impossible, I think, really. 
Int:	Yeah, just the sheer amount and the time and everything that’s going on. 
R:	Yeah. Time is definitely a big thing because staffing has always been under pressure. It was under pressure before the pandemic in health and social care, there’s nothing new there. There’s nothing exciting there, is there? It adds on more pressure because especially with someone with dementia there’s virtually no chance that you could give someone an iPad and let them chat to their daughter for 20 minutes. That is highly unlikely to be successful so it really means that you would have to put a staff member onto that communication, which is fine, that’s okay, but again it’s just, right, okay, so you’ve got 25 people, that’s a lot of time, isn’t it? 
Int:	Yeah and fitting it in, like you say, so you had that sense of having to maybe schedule them in and plan them in but that doesn’t always go to plan as well. 
R:	No, it doesn’t always go to plan because also that person might be having a bad morning or a bad hour, disinterest. It’s hard, isn’t it? You lose that spontaneity. 
Int:	Just picking up on what you said about some of the family members themselves perhaps being older adults themselves, so did you come across any difficulties with – I know you said it was quite challenging – with actually engaging them in the first place like, “We’re going to do Skype.” What kind of barriers did you come up for them?
R:	Just lack of skills and who can blame them? I get that. Lack of skills. There’s a lack of support out there. So in a pandemic maybe where, this is random, Mr [name] would have had this daughter-in-law come and visit him and help him with his iPad, that had all gone away, hadn’t it? It was a bit of a vicious cycle in a sense that they were at home mainly on their own not seeing very many people where a grandchild, a teenager might have popped in to help them with an iPhone, that had gone away. So there were some people and continue to be some people even to this day that just won’t interact that way. Quite a few. I mean it’s different now because we’ve got slightly less restrictive visiting so that’s good but it was such a relief when we were able to offer that.  
Int:	No, that’s interesting. It sounds like you’re almost at the end of a chain that was being affected further down by people not being able to get that technology support and there’s only so much you could do, it sounds like. 
R:	Yeah. The Welsh Government and our local authority were really supportive in helping, you know, giving us those couple of iPads just literally on a Friday afternoon. That’s fantastic. That’s really helpful. At the time we didn’t have WiFi throughout the building. That’s been corrected now, but at the time they were all 5G enabled and that was brilliant of the Welsh Government. Fantastic. We were heavily reliant on that but that’s not helping the person on the other end of the call, is it?
Int:	Yeah. It needs both sides to work, doesn’t it? That’s [over speaking].
R:	Yeah. Don’t get me wrong, there were lots of benefits and positive stuff and thank God we had it, but I know there was also quite a lot of people who just didn’t have the contact at all. 
Int:	Have you got any examples of a story or anything where it’s been really positive for somebody? I know you said there were some times where it was really funny or it went really well. 
R:	I’m not there operationally so I went in and did a few sessions with people and one of them was definitely when I was able to set up a session with two sons who both lived in [name of city] so they were not allowed to move at all. We did that in the office, got them all fine, great, and walked them through to their dad who was just so heartened and cheery. We hadn’t told him because it was a surprise because I thought well there’s no point really trying to explain it to this guy because he’s just not going to really understand the concept. He was just absolutely delighted and they were doing singing together and he’s a very, very religious man so he was doing his singing and blessings on them. It was just so sweet. They were thrilled because that dad, he had been in hospital for many months and so he actually came out to us. That was the first time that they had seen their dad, even digitally, because obviously hospitals aren’t able to support and who can blame them? It’s just never going to happen, is it? So that was heartening for them because they saw their dad and he looked well because he’d been with us for six weeks and put on loads of weight and was clearly jolly and he was crying. It was just delightful. 
Int:	That’s really lovely. It’s so good to know that there are those examples, especially like you were saying in a context that must be so hectic and challenging but it’s nice to know that there were those good success stories. 
R:	Yeah, few and far between though. I’d say mostly it was people just going, “Yeah, yeah,” and walking off or just turning it off and we’re just like, “Right, okay.”
Int:	Yeah, so I suppose that would be the flipside of that question would be those examples where it didn’t go well but, like you said, it’s more where it was too distressing or too confusing and not the right thing. 
R:	I think a lot of it is just comprehension, isn’t it? There are so many challenges with communication on dementia, especially advanced dementia. This doesn’t work a lot of the time for dementia people, they need to see someone slightly to the right of them on their eyeline. You want to have quiet, calm, basic conversations. It’s quite hard to do, isn’t it, because even like this you feel like you want to fill a space, don’t you? Especially for families you want to just chat and, “Have a look at this.” It’s quite a lot going on so I’m not sure, I think it probably did the families better than the actual person. 
Int:	Well I suppose like you say even being able to have that visual to actually see the person probably both sides but especially for the family on the outside to see somebody when they couldn’t otherwise and just a telephone call doesn’t bring that so I suppose was there an element of that that even just to see them was quite nice. 
R:	I’m sure it was. I mean I can’t talk over them, obviously, but I also think there is probably lots of challenges to that which is it’s quite shocking to see someone. Also, if that’s your only proper contact visually, I think families, quite understandably and I would be the same, is that they were looking for issues and they were looking for problems and they were looking for, “Mum’s deteriorated.” That’s basically because they’re just not allowed in, are they? Who can blame them? You’d do the same, wouldn’t you, if it was your own mum in there. You would be doing exactly the same. 
	So I think there were a lot of challenges. It was lovely for lots of them to have that little chat. We have a lot of families all over the place and they would not have been able to travel anyway, would they? Maybe half of our families are local. That’s a lot of people that aren’t local, isn’t it? That was really the only way that they could do it. 
Int:	That’s it, it was all just reduced to that, wasn’t it? Quite a few times within there not knowing how long that would be the case for as well. 
R:	Yes, horrendous. Yeah. 
Int:	I don’t know if it’s something your organisation would do but if you’ve had any kind of chance to evaluate any of the use of technology or whether that’s something you plan to do to see how it’s gone.
R:	You know what? We haven’t and we probably should have. I wonder if it’s a bit late in the day really now to do that. It would have been good to do that. We run surveys every now and again although, to be honest, the pandemic has put a halt to anything that isn’t absolutely essential, to be honest. One of the things that we do do is, ‘is your level of communication acceptable, okay,’ all the rest of it. I think people would say that we all did our best in a trying situation. There’s probably not much more that you can say on that. I think it worked some days and it didn’t work other days. Families were very frustrated by it because even when you do your best to book in times and slots, etc, if the care team on the day are one short and there’s a little crisis going on, they’re not going to prioritise the Skype call at 3:30pm. 
	It’s full of challenges without someone being there as a digital eagle really. I think that’s what we would have liked to have done but, again, there’s so much around the difficulties of employing someone to only do that, money, time, effort, digital skills. Also having someone there because we did think about moving one of the admin staff to basically just go and do that all day, but also, it’s difficult because that resident won’t necessarily know that person. That’s quite tricky to do as well so that was an idea that was floated but quickly left. 
Int:	Yeah, so because you’re almost balancing actually having the care staff provider is probably better for the person but also not so practical on a caring level. 
R:	Yeah, because that person will know the care staff, the care staff will know their good times, their bad times, the words that will encourage them. They just know them much more rather than like an administrator. Lovely as that person would have been we just thought it would be a step too far for an already challenging situation.  
Int:	No, that makes sense. I suppose you said there was some element of in the other home as well that they had used technology and they were accessing Zoom and things like that already, how do you see it going forward then now? I appreciate we’ve been in a bit of a strange time with the pandemic just now but how do you see the balance of face to face and remote technology being used?
R:	In the psychiatric nursing home in [name of city], being a in a psychiatric nursing home that’s a very challenging resident. They’ve just automatically got far fewer family contacts. Literally a handful of people would have family contact or friends contact. That’s mainly phone. Sometimes on Zoom or whatever. They’re quite good at that, so I think that’s going fine. They have mainly face to face contact in whatever way so that’s great and they go out and all the rest of it. In [name of care home] I think we’ve pretty much abandoned online for now and it’s face to face. It’s so much more effective for people living with dementia and families want that, of course they do. Even the families further away are absolutely seemingly to prefer phone conversations and a single visit every few weeks as a maybe more nature thing for that family. 
Int:	That’s interesting. I know obviously you’ve mentioned about the staffing and the time but is there anything else you could see that would make technology a better part of that that could be done to incorporate it in a more successful way. 
R:	I just struggle to see without some really big improvements on the technology how that is going to work. Please God forbid if we went into a proper lockdown situation or much more restrictions, we would obviously have to look at it again and I think one of the things we would probably do is ideally run digital, family training, which is maybe a bit of coaching about how to talk, which is terrible, isn’t it? How to chat on Zoom or Skype or whatever with someone with dementia. It’s terrible because it’s just too busy and too far away from their actual relative. So I think unless there are some massive improvements in that I can’t really see how that will ever work. 
Int:	It’s really interesting to hear from you on it because it’s a specific area that’s got specific needs to help to get those people to feel less isolated but, like you say, you’re balancing so many different things. 
R:	I think the isolation and loneliness, the focus has been on, and I know this sounds terrible to say this but when you’ve got more advanced dementia your world comes in a little bit, doesn’t it? The focus has actually been the community in the home. By moving away from your home with just you, maybe on your own or with a husband or wife coming into a community like ours with activities, either one to one or a group and just being around people, that decreases your social isolation just by being in a place where there’s chat. Also for a lot of women it’s being in a community where there’s lots of women. We’ve got lots of men as well, don’t get me wrong, but I think particularly as a women sometimes there’s little sections and it looks like a little WI even though they’ve all got dementia and all talking about different things. I think you feel you want to be part of that a little bit. 
Int:	Yeah, there’s still that social element there no matter what, isn’t there?
R:	Yeah, that emotional intelligence, that social intelligence is still there just in a different way, isn’t it? That’s very hard for families as well, isn’t it? Families take great comfort in seeing that their resident is being looked after, is quite happy, etc, so actually it’s decreased the pressure on the visit in a way. Their visit can just be a 20-minute visit and we’ve made an outside space as well, a nice garden area so, again, they can just talk about birds, about flowers. It’s not needing to put too much pressure on that single visit. 
Int:	No, that makes complete sense. That’s really interesting, thank you.

Recording Details:		P011












Int:	So you were just going to tell me about your role and the organisation you work for.
R:	So it’s a new role which is in [type of organisation].  So I work for [name of organisation] now.  It’s a new role in adult services which literally came into play in October, so I moved over in October from the health board, and it’s around early intervention, prevention and community support, so it’s like the longest title in the world.  I am trying to get it down but it’s not working [laughter].
	And basically it was brought in to start, well not start, but to enhance that preventative model, the early intervention work that adult services seems to like almost skim over to some degree, and it was really around bringing together then that third sector, the community response for not just adult services, but then [inaudible 00:58] engaging wider with the council.  So that’s my new role.
	Within that then I [work with] local area coordinators.  I [work with] our volunteering, so we’re establishing a new volunteering element for the council to coordinate both internal and external volunteering opportunities, so that’s kind of new and quite exciting actually.  I manage the housing support grant project as part of that, so homelessness, substance misuse; that comes under that remit, and what else do I manage?  Oh and carers.  I’ve got the remit for carers as well.  So it’s quite a lot of that, the community support element that links in across from 18 up really.
	Prior to coming into this role I was seven years in the [name of organisation] as their [job title]. So in that role I worked closely with the local authority managing reablement, assisted technology, acute clinical nursing, I didn’t do district nursing, I had a relief, social work element and what else was it?  Oh, reablement therapy and OT elements as well, and hospital discharge as part of that.  
	So that was my other previous role, and I guess the reason I’ve gone back to early intervention and prevention is because actually my background is the third sector, so a lot of my career has been third sector, criminal justice, young people, substance misuse, so it’s been quite broad coming in.
Int:	Yeah.  It sounds really interesting.  You’ve got lots going on and had lots going on, so it sounds very busy.  So I guess just within that then, I guess when you did the survey initially you were probably in your role before you were saying, so if you could just talk around your experience generally.  We’re looking obviously mainly at how things happened over the pandemic, so I guess that spans over the both anyway.  But how much focus has there been on preventing loneliness and social isolation for older adults particularly?
R:	So I think when the pandemic started there was a lot of focus on the local area coordinators, who at that time had a much larger patch.  So in [name of city] we’re divided into clusters.  We mirror the GP clusters, the GP networks.  So there's three of them in [name of area], and we were in the middle actually of an adult services change to realign adult services to the clusters as well.  So the local area coordinators were set up for each of the clusters, and we only had, at that time, six, so that was two people per cluster.  So that’s quite a significant area to cover of 144,000 population, so they’ve quite a substantial remit.
	As part of that they were then asked to engage with the local community groups and start to bring in mechanisms for ensuring people could keep communicating.  So, one of the things, local to me as it happens, is a community group, part of the church, lots of older people there, lots of people come together.  They don’t always do church things, they do community groups there as well, and the coordinator’s very much integral to setting up the WhatsApp groups linking them together, sort of making sure that they had a network set up  before she stepped back, because as the pandemic hit, they got re-purposed elsewhere.  
	And that was replicated actually across all of the LACs. That’s what they were doing then, was trying to set up digital networks, Facebook, WhatsApp groups.  Not so much Zoom.  We haven't been such a big, not that I know much, many have used Zoom, but it seemed to be more WhatsApp, Facebook groups and general just backup for sharing numbers.  So that was done across the borough, therefore obviously making sure that connections were maintained.
	We then had a callout to volunteers and that’s where the volunteering part of the service provision started, and that’s where we’ve taken it from.  So as that developed we noticed there was a need for that befriending, that wellbeing checks and for individuals.  So that’s something that we’re now taking as part of my work plan, to develop that, to enhance opportunities for befriending.  So at the moment we’ve got about 80 volunteers on our book, and of those I would say the majority are befriending calls that are happening at the moment, and again that was really about keeping in touch with older people, making sure that the carers that they were linked in with as well had opportunities to engage with other people, and that could have been, some people did face to face.  Other people were much more around that telephone call, telephone conversations.
	So that was parallel then, as we started to open up services again, as we sort of got into the dip of the wave where the LACs were then back in post and were able to work with our volunteer coordinators to make sure that we can make sure those groups were running again, just making sure that where people had lost confidence to come out, that we could do some work around that, and looking at then the walking groups, the community, just like little knit and natter groups, just sort of starting to bring those back out to engage people back in as well.
	On the flip side of that, what was also happening was a digital push.  So there was a digital push from the local authority and also a digital push from the health board, so recognising not on a regional but very much on a local footprint that we have quite an established assisted technology team, and as part of the assisted technology model we wanted to start broadening out away from just a button and a box and your lifeline normal sort of opportunity.  So we started to look at MemRabels.  We started to look at some, if you don’t know what MemRabel is, it’s just like literally, it’s a pre-programmed service, not a pre-programme, you can pre-programme it and it sends you reminders, and it’s almost like a basic version of Alexa really.
	So part of what we were also look for was looking at how we can utilise Alexas, how we can utilise Google Play, you know, the things which people buy to put in houses, how can we maximise on  that?  So there was a bit of a project set up to look at engaging people through Alexas.  It’s a very small project that we did.  But it was that, coupled with digital literacy.  So on one hand it was looking at people’s wellbeing and older people being able to use that, but then also looking at it from a perspective of upskilling and digitalisation as well.  
	And that went well.  It was all done initially quite remotely, as you can imagine, and then we did manage to get a couple of people together and then it was back remotely.  So it’s not a huge project, but it’s the start of that engagement for older people and connecting them, I guess, with not just Alexa and MemRabel and things, but also like if other family members have got it, I don’t think people realise you can phone them via your Alexa or talk to, do you know what I mean? There’s [overtalking 09:21] in that.
Int:	[Overtalking 09:21, yeah, no that’s really interesting, thank you.  You’ve covered loads there already.  Yeah, it’s interesting you say that, so it’s not just knowing the technology’s there, but there’s all this other stuff that it can do, but I wonder, how did that go in terms of its early stages, maybe introducing somebody to a device, or I don’t know if you were providing the devices or people have them themselves?  I just wonder how it went to start off.  It’s a bit difficult sometimes, isn't it?
R:	So we have bought Alexas and we’re establishing our Alexa suite so people can come, staff members now will be trained up on exactly what Alexa can support with and how it can link to your heating, how it can link to your doorbells, do you know what I mean?
Int:	Yeah.
R:	The possibilities are huge.  So we’ve just recently or we are setting it up.  I think it’s been delayed because of this other wave now as everything else has, hasn’t it.  But initially I think the people we were choosing were people that we’d had good relationships with, maybe through their [inaudible 10:37] and family members were phoning up and saying, “I’ve got mum an Alexa, I don’t need that anymore,” and then we’d have the conversation, well okay, let’s look at what we can enhance with the Alexa, and do you know it does this.  
	So it started from, the idea came from very much like just those general conversations we were having in from people, and then it was like, well why aren't we using it?  Why aren't we maximising on it?  How can we as a council, what is our role in this and how can we, you know, so that’s kind of where it came from.  So in essence they had bought it, the idea came and now we’ve bought some.
Int:	Yeah, no that’s really interesting.  So it’s quite an organic way that it happened because it was already there, and then you can, yeah, like you say, it sounds like then you’ve made a whole kind of project based around it, so that sounds really good.
	And so when those initial conversations happen and you’re getting people introduced to them or getting things set up, what kinds of things are going on to encourage people to use them?  Are people quite keen?  Are people interested?  How does that go?
R:	A bit of a mixed bag as you’d expect really. I think, and this is maybe where we’ve been a little bit selective, so obviously we want to trial it out with people who want to give it a go initially and then iron out some of the hiccups before offering it wider.  
	But certainly I think it’s the family is the key. So if you’ve got family or you want to keep in touch with family, that’s the key to encouraging, so the gran or grandparents to be more involved with it, and I think sometimes they become your tech people as well.  They’re in the house and you can have sometimes those conversations them; well if you pull this out and do it that way.
	But I would say people have been really responsive to it.  Hesitant at first, because they’re unsure about what it is, oh it’s listening to all my conversations, why is it that colour, turning it off.  That’s also one.  Just little things like that.  But I think generally people have been really positive about what it can do.  There have been some frustrations, I will say, around accents.  When you’ve got some of like the Welsh speaking [inaudible 13:02] has been a bit of a problem, but everyone takes it in a bit of jest and then we have got round it I think sometimes.  
	And we’ve tried the Google Home hubs as well just to see what the difference is, and I think there’s much more user friendliness with the Alexa.  So when you set up the Alexa as well, obviously you need to have it on your phone or on a computer device, and what we’ve found is that sometimes we’ve had to maybe put it on the family’s or the relative’s one rather than it being on theirs.  But then saying that, you’ve got some really tech savvy older people there as well, and I think sometimes we say, “Oh they don’t know about it,” but actually you can’t, it’s a sweeping statement isn't it?  I know my dad’s in his 70s and he’ll jump over my head sometimes with his tech knowledge.
Int:	And what do you think that’s around then, because I was going to ask you about how different, like what you’ve sort of found about different groups of people within the clients, and so the people who are more confident or have more tech skills, do you know where that’s come from or what that’s about?
R:	I think it’s being exposed to it.  So I’m just going to go on personal experience.  So my nan used to work with computers when she was younger.  She was like one of the, so from her perspective she used to have loads of different tech in the house just to, not necessarily she would use it all, and when her dementia kicked in she didn’t really understand it, but she was more aware of it.  
	And I think again it comes down to family or friends and being able to access those digital classes, and just being a bit more up for doing things.  I think the groups where we found there was little engagement around it was if they either were couples, believe it or not, older couples where there wasn’t such a reliance on being on your own maybe and needing, you know, writing down your note.  
	It’s weird.  It was a bizarre situation I guess in many respects, but the people that I think are, that were more closer were the ones which were less likely to want to try it out, because the value of it was less unless they had very good supportive families around them, and friends, who would encourage it.  But it seemed to be the more, maybe they’d been bereaved for a few years and then you would be looking at then using, okay this is a way, introducing it, family, may have said, “We want to keep in touch,” we can do it this way, and you know you can get the video ones now.
Int:	Yeah.
R:	So it was just that then gives a face to something, and I think people then became a lot less afraid of it, and especially if they had mobile phones, then this was just like another bit of -
Int:	Yeah, linking it all together.  That’s interesting you say then about people who perhaps were less directly isolated were less keen.  So I suppose that sort of supports the point of it in a way, that the people who were more on their own were the people who were more keen to be involved and be engaged.
	And is there anything other than just sort of single or who’s in the household, but is there anything around age or whereabouts people were that was another group factor that you could have identified in how people were engaged?
R:	I can’t remember off the top of my head, to be honest, if there was anything with areas.  We do have some hot spots where the internet is very sparse or connection isn't, particularly in some of the [name of area] and also in [inaudible 16:50], so we’ve got two valleys either side of us, and the higher up you go the less likely sometimes you’re going to have good quality, or good choice anyway, provider.
	So that does impact, and sometimes you get hot spots up there where there is just nothing.  So I would imagine that would have impacted on it, but I haven't got that in my head to say.
Int:	Yeah, no that makes sense and I think especially with Wales it’s been quite interesting to know that that geographical side of things is quite relevant because there’s so many rural areas, but then mixed in with the other, so the internet access sounds like that can be a barrier.  And is that something that your organisation was able to support with or were you reliant on the client to do it?
R:	So we do have like a number of iPads and stuff which are 4G, so we were able to go up and we are able to lend them out to people as well.  I think it was only a handful that we ended up actually doing that with, and that again was a bit of a, not really around utilising the Alexas, but certainly using the iPads and Skype and Teams, and allowing people to meet with friends maybe who were further away.  
	And it links with the local area coordinators, because part of their role is sort of sitting down and doing some of that engagement with individuals to get them more savvy in terms of how to use equipment.  Obviously there was that big lull that we had in between, but I think where we weren’t doing some of the face to face visits or able to go into people’s houses, you know, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, all of that social media became so important.  
	And from a council perspective we did have links to it, so if you were, again not everybody had it in terms of internet access, but certainly there were phone numbers then which would allow people to access the front door of adult services and then come into our Safe and Well, which is then the link to our befriending and our food delivery and pharmacy bits, so it’s kind of, we try to cover all bases.
Int:	It sounds like you did manage to reach most people then, but what is your sense of there being any unmet need, people that you’re not able to reach when it was only remote services?
R:	Yeah definitely there was a, I think we probably didn’t, [inaudible 19:31] say, we’ve got a population of older people, 65 plus, I think it’s about 23,000 in [name of city], so of that I would say we probably only hit about 5% of that population if I’m honest.  I think the rest of it, we did have a lot of response through our front door and the telephone contact.  Yeah, it’s a tricky one isn't it?  I think it probably was about 5% actually, thinking about it.  But then not everybody needed it.
Int:	Yeah, it’s a percentage within a percentage I suppose.
R:	Yeah exactly.
Int:	And so you mentioned about people when like introducing technology, and people being a bit fearful, and we know that that’s quite a big barrier for some older adults, is that fear around using technology, and it might be not wanting to break things or being afraid of scams and fraud and things like that.  So was that an issue that came up quite often, and how did you get around that or manage to persuade people?
R:	Just talking to them I think, you know, the staff that we had going out and sort of working people were really, look, have it, try it, don’t worry about it, just give it a go for a few days.  Just leave it in the house.  Leave it there so it just doesn’t do anything, do you know, or if you want to have a play with it, just have a go.  So it was just really about doing it in a softly, softly approach with people and not forcing it down their throats.  So you don’t have to have it, but if you do, this is what the possibilities could be of it.
	And then one of the ones that sticks with me is around washing machines.  So we were saying, “Well you’ve got a new washing machine, you can use that.  So you can learn new things.  So this is just a smaller version of your washing machine in many respects,” and sort of building it that way, getting people to think about, it’s not, my god, it’s not a computer that’s watching me or anything.  It’s a tool which I can use rather than.
	Some people didn’t want to use it and some people would prefer the Teams with families, and they liked to know how to Skype so that they could see their neighbours and keep that friendship going.  But for others then it became really helpful.  It became a way of talking to people for some, even just Alexa answering you back and you leaving messages because you’ve been used to talking to somebody for so long, it just became not a silent house, which is quite nice.
Int:	Yeah, just knowing that it’s there, yeah, definitely.  And so in terms of the work that you do and how you were working before and then had to adapt with things, what effect did that technology have on you and  your colleagues and how you worked?
R:	Well we all had to try it.  We had to try all of these tech at first.  So that was really good, and sometimes it was quite funny.  We’d be in meetings and then we’d mention Alexa and then all of our Alexas would go off, because they were like, “Hello, hello?  Don’t know the answer to that question.”
	So for us we learnt stuff from it as well.  We were learning about all the different, you know, the opportunities.  There’s a programme, I don’t know if you, I’m going to get this wrong, ITTP?  And basically it links programmes to programmes.  
	So if I’m using, oh what’s it called?  If I’m using like, I don’t know, I can’t think what it’s called at the moment, but like an opportunity for tasking, putting tasks and organising myself, and I think of something that I want to add to it then I can tell, if I do an ITTP link to it, I can say to Alexa, “Alexa, add this to my board,” and it will do it for you.  So it was very much about us learning about really cool ways in which we could use it for more productivity and work as well.  So that was good.	
	And for one of us they had, well, no, two of us actually, they hadn't had it before.  They hadn't used that, whereas for two of us, we’ve got a number of them scattered around the house, so it was really good, and they’ve still got it now.  I think they’ve actually gone and bought themselves a new one, so that was positive.	
	The other good thing was it really opened up our minds to possibilities of what you’ve got in your own home and how we can maximise on it, and from that we were looking at what kind of apps, what kind of things could we do to potentially develop and link in.
	So, one of the things that I’ve always thought around is you’ve got a lot, lots of people or some people wear these smart watches, there’s a lot of tech which we could pick up data and knowledge from around, and it’s just about how we do it, and I don’t think we got to the how, but it just broadened our minds to not just be thinking of assisted technology as a button and a box.  It was just, well how can we make this work, and not just for older people but for people with learning disabilities, for younger people in supported living accommodation?  What could we bring in?
	So yeah, it’s been a really positive world we’re in, and I think we’re just on the journey.  We by no means have cracked it.  I wouldn’t say that at all, but we’ve certainly, it’s certainly a journey that we’ve started, and there’s a lot of buy-in from it, definitely from the local authority into what we can do, and to start doing some more pilots and proving some of this as well, which is good.
Int:	Yeah, because I was going to ask you about how you see things in the future, how the balance of face to face or remote might look for you.
R:	So from a tech perspective then in terms of our assisted tech, though as part of the team around that there has been like a wellbeing officer brought in, somebody who then can do those wellbeing calls, check in on people, make sure that they are using the technology appropriately, and almost like having a wellbeing discussion with somebody and not just being focused on, oh you just need a, you know, I don’t know, a lifeline, having a conversation which looks at strengths of family, and then looking at a number of options which could be utilised to support that individual.
	And I think that’s very much where we’re going on our early intervention and prevention journey as well.  So we’ve got the LACs and my direction to them is you do face to face.  You go and you speak to people as much as they want you to be face to face with them these days.  We’ll still do that and we’ll do that risk assessment that goes with it.
	On the flip side we now have another option, which is the tech side of things where we can, okay, perhaps we’ll just get in contact via the phone or we’ll do it via Teams, we’ll set you up and then if you need to contact us.  And from a staffing perspective that works much better as well in terms of being able to remotely work and isolating.  You’re just working from home really, aren't you, and still able to do some of your job.
	The other bit I would say around it has been, so, oh I’ve completely forgot my thought.  We were talking about that and then we were talking about, what was I talking about?
Int:	So you were saying about the different things that you’ve been doing and how it made a difference for your work side, and that you could do things remotely.
R:	So the combination of the EIP service, I thought I could hear somebody at the door, that's what distracted me, sorry, the EIP services around that wellbeing and doing those wellbeing assessments from the front to be able to push people, not push people, but direct people into alternatives around them, and as part of that we need to have a number of options to choose from.  So if that if face to face, if that is tech, if that is group work then we will try and accommodate where possible.  And actually we are for some doing training courses for community groups via Teams and stuff.
Int:	Okay and what's the engagement like with that?  Are people quite keen for that?
R:	Yeah.  Actually now people have got used to doing it there's much more, people are more up for it, I think because some of the fear over COVID and getting back together, but then it’s really tricky isn't it, because the good thing about that is then you can share numbers and people can get engaged outside of those sessions.  On the flip side you never some of them.  It’s that engagement bit for people, isn't it?  Sometimes going out to that group was the only time they’d go out.
	I think some of it, no, not some of it, it very much is the personal feeling of doing things, and we have to roll with what the person wants to do at the end of the day.  You can’t force them to do different things.
Int:	Yeah and so when there was, as you’ve mentioned, lots of different things that were kind of trialled and were being put in place to address loneliness and isolation, but were there any unexpected positive effects from having used the digital technology to address loneliness that you can think of?
R:	For me it was around those WhatsApp groups if I’m honest, those naturally formed groups that were put together to make sure that people could stay in contact with each other that would never have shared their numbers potentially within those community groups, because they’re still active.  They still very much are the community engagement action groups in our like neighbourhoods and towns and villages.  And some of the comments that we’ve had is like, “Well we’ve all stayed in touch, we know everyone’s alright,” and “[Inaudible 30:48] popping out to get so-and-so some bread,” or something, so they became natural connections in the community, which has been, for me, has been positive.
	I think the other thing which is really clear to me is that we don’t have a loneliness and isolation strategy.  So that’s one of the things which I’ve taken on board and I’ve started to do alongside with our colleagues in [name of organisation], to develop something. And then underneath that then, what we’ll have is an action plan to address loneliness and isolation across all age groups, and be able to address some of the funding into, so if there’s third sector organisations coming forward we’ll be able to have a really clear framework for being able to direct some of those funding opportunities.
Int:	Yeah and that leads me a little bit on to, we were going to ask about whether you’ve done any formal evaluation of what's been done so far in terms of this.
R:	No.  We haven't got that far.
Int:	Yeah but is that something that you plan to do, maybe looking forward at that strategy?
R:	Yeah definitely.  Yeah, we haven't done it.  It’s just been on sort of time and ability to do it at this stage, but going forward it will feed into that and there will be opportunities.  I’d like something more formal.  I’d like something like an external evaluation of it once it’s all up and running because, I don’t know, it’s just been really positive what’s happened and what's come from it from a, I wouldn't say anecdotal, because we have had quite a bit of information, quantitative perspective really.  So yeah, it’s -
Int:	But yeah, I suppose, yeah, it’s not easy to plan it in, you know, there probably would be all sorts of support that you would need to get that done, and it’s, yeah, it’s interesting to think about.  
R:	We have had some funding from Welsh government around isolation and loneliness, and we had money in which was to say to go to the grassroots organisations around it, and that’s where I kind of just said, well, we’d just be giving it out for giving it out’s sake.  We need to have a structure around it over the next few years, and then have a monitor around it and evaluate where we’ve been putting the money, rather than it just being a scattergun, which is easy to do, but we don’t know if it’s making any difference and we want to be able to prove it.  
	And I think a lot of the work around the EIP, around the volunteering, it fits within isolation and loneliness, and there is something around our engagement with younger people and how actually technology has been engaging younger people who are isolated and lonely, albeit that they’re much [inaudible 33:47] more au fait, not everyone, not all of them.  
	But I think there needs to be much more of a broader look at it now rather than, I think a lot of attention goes to older people in isolation, but actually by that point a lot of them, this is going to sound awful and I don’t mean it, what I’m going to say, I’ll explain myself, a lot of them already are isolated and lonely.  There is an opportunity to do something, to put some preventative measures in place to stop people getting to the stage of being older and all of a sudden being isolated and lonely.  So that’s what I’m trying to say.
Int:	No I know what you mean.  Yeah, it makes sense to, rather than that happening all of a sudden, there’s maybe a way of building things up beforehand, and there may be a space for technology within that then it sounds like.
R:	Yeah.
Int:	And you’ve covered a lot of the positive examples, but I suppose the flip side to that, were there any kind of unexpected negative effects that you came across from using technology for loneliness at all?
R:	Not particularly.  I think people like people and they like going out and seeing people, so it doesn’t answer all, it’s not a tick all bo-, what’s the saying?  It isn't a catch-all, sorry.  So yeah, I think there is something to be said about needing the balance between the two.  Yes, it’s great in a pandemic, in an emergency and in a crisis, but if that was your day in, day out, there are other ways in which it can be balanced against being able to have some of that community element, and being able to have the digital.
Int:	Yeah, so feeling like it can’t fully replace it but maybe - 
R:	No.
Int:	- yeah, familiar with it.
R:	Makes it easier but it’s not the answer to everything.  I’m really sorry.  I have to go to another meeting.
Int:	That’s fine.  Thank you so much for taking the time.  If there was anything else, just drop me an email, but yeah, you have to run, don’t worry.  Thank you so much.  You take care.
R:	Yeah and you as well.  Bye.
Int:	Thank you.  Bye.

Recording Details:		P010













Int:	… a brief overview of your role and the organisation that you work for?
R:	I work with [name of organisation] which really, the long name is the [longer name of organisation] but we’re going as the [name of organisation] and we’re working across the [name of city and area] Wales, in [name of county].  
	I’m the [job title] for the [name of project] which is a befriending and support project for older people in the area, particularly those who are vulnerable and we’re working very much within the COVID19 situation. Many of our older people are vulnerable, isolated and we’re trying to mitigate that through all sorts of activities like we provide a weekly hot meal, but it’s unique in the sense that we phone the older people up, they get their hot meals delivered, just to find out how they are and what meal do they want, do they still want a meal and I’m managing a team of volunteers which are drawn from the local community, many of whom are older themselves and they actually deliver the meals, so they’re linked into the community, they know the vulnerable people and they know of any issues.   
	We also give out food boxes and we’re developing a programme of activities to try to get the older people out of their houses and some of those are inter-generational, so it’s quite a big project, there’s a lot going on.
Int:	It sounds like there’s loads going on.  So that part of phoning up and providing the hot meals, is that the befriending service or is that something separate?
R:	It’s part of the befriending service but we also have volunteers who do telephone befriending and actually visit people in their houses, if the older people are okay with that, some of them aren’t and we’ve found that a lot of older people are still very, very scared to leave their homes and very scared to see people, so it’s a mixture of telephone befriending and face to face befriending, maybe taking people out.  
Int:	My next question was about the focus was about the focus on loneliness and isolation, it sounds like that’s a really big focus for your organisation.  The focus on preventing that feeling of isolation and loneliness, is that something that’s always been there for you or is that since COVID?   
R:	Well, I’ve only been in this job for nine months, I came down from [name of city] to take it up but I have worked in Wales previously and I was working in older people services and I found that loneliness and isolation as a massive problem, long before COVID.  
	I think COVID’s highlighted it but it’s always been there and what concerns me is some of the community organisations can’t manage without funding and there’s been a lot of COVID funding to combat loneliness and isolation, what worries me is the funders don’t see it as a long term issue and they really need to look at it as a long term issue.  
	It’s going to be worse post COVID because it’s a lot of anxiety, mental health issues, people have lost their spouses, in [name of area] it’s a problem because given the geography, there are rows and rows of terraced houses up mountains and not much … so it’s difficult to get out if you don’t have transport.  There’s a whole raft of issues there around loneliness and isolation.
Int:	It’s something that we’re talking to people from all over Wales and the geographical thing is quite interesting because there definitely seems to be those pockets where you're isolated anyway geographically, so within that to be socially isolated sounds like it’s really quite a challenge.
R:	Yes, it is.  I’ve worked in rural areas, the last area I came from was like a 14 house village in [name of city], very much an older population, the nearest shop was 17 miles away but in that small setting, people really supported each other.  Whereas in a larger urban conurbation, I think people can get lost.   
Int:	So that’s an interesting side to it, sometimes that community sense is stronger when it’s a small area.  You mentioned about COVID, just thinking back to the early days of COVID, you’ve not been in this role so long so you’ve probably had a few waves of lockdowns or not lockdowns, we’ve had all different, what sorts of things are you aware of that your organisation was thinking about in terms of how technology would need to be used because of the pandemic?
R:	Again, I wasn’t around during that time but from where I was before and I did try and it wasn’t working, but I was very much involved in volunteering and I was [job title] of a small community hub in a tiny rural area, but we found that video links and Facetime were really important for some people, those who had family and access to technology but not everyone does and some of the older, older people, in their 80s and 90s, just have nothing, they don’t even have a mobile phone. 
Int:	I was going to ask you which groups within the older people that you work with are more where the technology is more of a challenge, it sounds like that age is relevant.  And so is that something that you found, they already don’t have the technology and then they’re not interested in having it?  Or is it something that they just are not able to have?  What’s going on there?
R:	Let me just think about this because we connected with Age Connect Cymru, Age UK in setting up digital inclusion workshops at a centre, we’ve got a really nice little centre and we offered lists to older people who wanted to come and learn about how to do Facebook and order shopping online and things like that, and we thought we would be inundated, we offered lists for people to come and there was very little take-up.  
	We’re trying to find out why, some of the reason was because they’re scared to come out but they didn’t want anyone in the house, some of it was because they didn’t have the technology anyway so they weren’t interested and they didn’t have anybody, and they could do their online shopping over the phone on a landline.  So it was a whole mixture of reasons why.  And yet there were some people who have had all the technology and are quite comfortable using it.
Int:	Why are those people more able to be engaged with the technology?  What’s led them to be in that position? 
R:	First of all, they’re interested and they have family and friends who can support them in this, but there’s a lot of people out there who don’t have anybody. 
Int:	It’s interesting because it sounds like people with family and people involved in their life have more access to things to stop them from being isolated, whereas the people who are more isolated to begin with would benefit from those things but don’t have them or aren’t being supported to do them. 
R:	That’s right, yeah and it’s through lockdown, there was online training, there was all sorts of things going on, it was the [inaudible 00:09:08] and whatever and some people linked into that and others just weren’t interested and others just couldn’t because they didn’t know about it.   
Int:	What kinds of things were you doing to try to engage people in those digital things during lockdown?  What were the strategies you were using to reach out to people and get them involved?
R:	From our organisation’s point of view, I don't think we were doing very much, it was just recently because we didn’t have the capacity.  Apparently, the organisation was just about to close because there was no money  and lockdown and a couple of staff were just about to be made redundant, one was working once day a week just to keep the centre open and then suddenly, they got this COVID funding to keep it going because there’s a kitchen and whatever, so there was a lot of emphasis on providing the hot meals.  
	Before I came, they were providing 50 Christmas lunches and that was about it but the money also came through to [inaudible 00:10:26] coordinator to get together a [name of project], so I brought the capacity to the organisation and within nine months, we’re doing the hot meals, we’ve got together a team of 35 volunteers and 20 of those are over 60.  We’ve got the digital inclusion project going and that’s a drop-in so it’s still going, any time they can drop in and whatever, we’re working with other organisations, we’ve got bits in now to look at how we can move the technology forward.  
	But I think technology doesn’t replace human contact does it?  And I think we’re focusing more on human contact now rather than the technology.
Int:	When you were in the times where you were reliant on the more technology side of it and you couldn’t do things face to face, was it primarily the telephone that you were using to talk to people?
R:	Yes.
Int:	Can you tell me a bit about how that went in terms of accessing people on the phone?
R:	It went really well, we’re still doing it because the hot meals service has grown from 50 Christmas lunches to now providing well over 130-150 meals once a week and we’re getting a lot of feedback, written feedback, verbal feedback that this has been a lifeline for them, that weekly telephone call but also the human contact because the volunteers deliver the meals and go to the doorstep.  
Int:	So the phone call is prior to the meal coming but it sounds like they’re getting value from the phone call anyway in itself.
R:	That’s right and first of all, I was making phone calls so that led me into the community because being new here, but now we’ve got volunteers and all the volunteers live in the community so it’s really becoming quite sustainable and the fact that it’s a community support in its own community, for those older people.
Int:	It sounds like quite good numbers to work with, definitely.
	When people have engaged with that set up with the meals and the telephone calls and the befriending, which kinds of people are those?  Are there differences?  Different groups within those people?
R:	Well, obviously they’re all older people, there’s a group of people who are single, who’ve lost spouses previously or just recently and so they have different needs.  There’s housebound who can’t get out which is why the befriending is so crucial and there are other groups who, you know, have their friends who aren’t really linked into technology but they phone each other and I’m finding now that as we’re putting on activities and offering events and things, that they’re coming out in little groups.  But we are providing transport which is important if people aren’t mobile.  Then there’s others who are quite linked in with families, living away or nearby who are well linked into technology, who are doing their online shopping and Facetiming and whatever.
Int:	With those, when you’re aware of people that are using those extra bits of technology like the video calls and things, is that something that your organisation then has helped them and supported them with as well, or is it mostly coming from family, that support?
R:	It’s mostly coming from family but we have supported people in that and there was one lady whose family live further away, she had a mobile phone which wasn’t very efficient so we worked with Social Services to get her a laptop or tablet and visited her and showed her how to use it, and she’s using it now and she’s really happy.  
Int:	We’re really interested in those stories because it’s interesting to know about the different kinds of people who have tried technology and it’s gone well and they’ve carried on, or some people who’ve tried it and it’s not gone so well or they’ve not kept it up.  Have you had any examples of that, where it’s not gone so well?  
R:	I don't think so.  There was one lady coming here who didn’t know how to use a mobile phone for online shopping, we showed her how to do that and she hasn’t been back so I’m assuming it went well, we don't know but I think what we need to do is keep in touch with her now to see how it’s going.
Int:	You mentioned about the digital inclusion drop-in, what kinds of things are people coming in with?  Is it mostly online shopping and connections or are they coming in with IT problems?
R:	Well no, they’re basically wanting to know how to use their mobile phones!  How they can get better use out of it, we have volunteers who are quite clued up, we have some young volunteers as well from the local school who have come in and shown what to do.  
Int:	One thing we know is a barrier for some older people is a fear of using technology, not wanting to break things or being afraid of scams and fraud, has that come up with the older adults you work with?
R:	The scam thing, yeah, definitely, people are wary about scams and I think there’s been a couple of times when someone’s been in touch with our receptionist, “I’ve just got this email, what do you think?”, so generally, yeah, there have been scams.
Int:	Do you think that’s putting some people off from getting involved with the technology?
R:	Yeah, absolutely because when we have spoken with people about upgrading their mobile phones, they’re not interested, “there’s so many scams going on”. 
Int:	You’ve not been there pre COVID but it sounds like you were more focused on the face to face and you're focusing on face to face going forward as well, offering that face to face connection but do you think there’s a place for technology as well within your organisation’s service going forward? 
R:	Absolutely, which is why we started the digital inclusion workshops and I think what we need to do is get some sort of survey out to find out how some of the older people, we know most of the isolated ones now, about how they feel about technology and what do they need and maybe you could help us do that!
Int:	It’s something I was going to ask because we’re interested in how people are evaluating things and getting feedback and you've mentioned you’ve had some really good feedback from people, verbal feedback, so is that more just through the conversations that you're having and meeting people?  Have you done any kind of formal evaluation yet of how things have gone?
R:	Not necessarily with technology but we did a survey, one of my first jobs when I came in, there’d been one done pre COVID about what activities the older people would like to see and what the challenges were to participation.  I thought really, we need one now during COVID and I know things are easing up but there’s still that anxiety there and so we did it online, no we didn’t do it online, we sent out paper copies, we telephone people and we got about 70 replies and it was interesting to see what activities they wanted, but digital inclusion didn’t come up at all in that.  
	But there were lots of challenges about loneliness and isolation, pre COVID it was pretty low on the agenda but post COVID, the recent one we did, it was very higher so that lack of transport, mobility problems, having nobody to go with and so I think maybe we could put another little survey out because that one was well subscribed to, about digital inclusion.  
Int:	Because it does sound like that perhaps the pandemic situation has almost shone a light on that sense of isolation, but then there’s been such a drive with the technology because all people were able to do was use the phone or use technology, so perhaps now those two things might come together and it sounds like your organisation is already doing a lot, it’s just seeing how to get people engaged isn't it?
R:	Yeah, but there are lots of challenges there you see because in our area, there’s a lot of poverty, fuel poverty and food poverty which we’re addressing with our partners and I think getting mobile phones and laptops are a really low priority in terms of what people need, it’s a bit like [inaudible 00:21:47].   
	To get lonely, isolated people out into the centre to learn about technology because we don’t have the capacity to go and work with each one individually in their homes, if they would allow us in their homes, we need transport, we need a hook to get them here and there isn't the funding available either, you need volunteer expenses, you need to help with transport costs, maybe even to provide the equipment.
	We are working with some very vulnerable people whose priority is heating the house and putting food on the table.
Int:	Where it brings in that issue is let alone the devices but then having internet access and data and things like that, is another level.
R:	Absolutely, yeah and I haven’t really seen much from the government about supporting people to do this.  It was quite interesting because I spent two years in [different continent] way back in the early 2000s, working on sustainable tourism projects with communities and the government at that time were saying, “we will have mobile phones in every community in [name of country]” but the problem was, it’s all right having a mobile phone but there just wasn’t the infrastructure and so much poverty and deprivation, and that’s what we are seeing here, you know?  
	I think having, if you've got nobody to communicate with, if you don’t have family and friends, what use is technology?  You wouldn’t have the human contact for a phone.  
Int:	It’s so true and it’s that thing that then coming back to the pandemic is what really did bring that because people couldn’t have those face to face interactions, so if you had no technology and you weren’t able to go anywhere then that was it.  
	I’m just wondering if you're aware of maybe the people who you're not able to reach?  Is there a sense of that unmet need that people maybe isolated, that you haven’t been able to get to in one way or another? 
R:	I’m sure there are.  We’ve got really good networks and it’s really important to have them so we’re not working in isolation, we’re working with the local authority, all the different departments, particularly with social work.  We’re working with other community groups that are really embedded in the community and know that the smaller areas, we’re getting referrals from them too.  In fact, we’re getting so many referrals now, it’s great.   
	But there are people out there who are so isolated, we just don't know about them.  
Int:	And you can only do so much and it sounds like you say, you’ve got good numbers and you're getting more and that sounds really positive.
R:	Absolutely, and the community [inaudible 00:25:24] and I think in the [name of area], there is a sense of community, I think people look out for each other because again, I’ve seen we’re getting referrals from Social Services and other agencies and organisations but we’re also getting referrals from neighbours, they’re a bit worried about so and so and family, my family who don’t live in the immediate vicinity who are phoning us up and emailing saying, “can you do something about my gran?” or whoever.  
Int:	There’s obviously good awareness of your organisation and people know to reach out which is great and will hopefully only continue going forward.
	In the survey you completed for us, you said you quite often use social media and I was wondering if you could tell me a bit about how that’s used to access older people.
R:	We use Facebook quite a lot, Facebook Messenger, we don’t get a lot of older people who are necessarily engaged in it but we are … we’ve got presence and other organisations’ pages who do target the older people.  
	We’ve got a website, we’ve got two interns from the [name of university] coming, who are looking at our social media technology, which is great, starting this month actually, for three months, so they’re going to be getting cracking on how to better reach through social media and website and whatever.  That’s in progress.
Int:	That’s really interesting because it’s another way of promoting things but it’s also being aware of who’s got access to seeing that as well.
R:	Yeah, that’s right.
Int:	You’ve mentioned a few positives but have you got any other kind of examples of positive effect that the use of technology has had in your organisation, whether that’s mostly with the phone or anything else?
R:	I think it’s mostly with the phone and the digital inclusion drop-in, it’s not fantastically subscribed to but I think that’s something we can work on.  So that’s been quite good and it’s also good working with [name of organisation] and their programme because they’re trying very hard to, have you been in touch with them?
Int:	Yes, there might be something, we’ve covered a lot of different organisations from different places so we’re probably picking things up from different areas as well.  
R:	But our befriending is generally just done by phone and we do provide volunteers with a phone, they don’t use their own phone.
Int:	The befriending, once it’s set up, does that continue regularly?  It’s not for a set period of time?
R:	No, it’s as long as it’s needed and as long as the volunteer is happy to do it.  We also work for the Red Cross who have a befriending service but theirs is for a set period of time. Sometimes, if they have someone that needs to, because their aim is to get people out and in Wales, the regulations are really strict and it’s really impacting on us, so we’re working with them as well.  But you’ve made me think, if the volunteers have got mobile phones and people they’re befriending have got mobile phones, maybe they can do Facetime or something like that.
Int:	When you've got a smartphone, you’ve almost got a little computer there haven’t you?
R:	I know and I don't think a lot of people realise, we found this through the digital inclusion, about how much they can do on their smartphone.  Sometimes they’re really surprised.
Int:	I think there’s something around people needing the support to use it, it’s been hard in the pandemic, I don't know if this something you’ve found and you've obviously got the digital inclusion now but when you couldn’t meet with people face to face, providing the support with technology over the phone is quite difficult to say, “click here” or “press that”.  
R:	Especially people who are older and maybe there’s a little bit of forgetfulness setting in, an older person like myself, I’m quite good with technology!
Int:	When the restrictions have been reduced and you can have a bit more face to face access, hopefully that’s a good time to show people and provide that support.
R:	Yes.
Int:	It’s interesting that you're working with other organisations and you've got those partnerships set up as well because that sounds like that really strengthens what you're doing.    
R:	[Does not respond.]
Int:	Sorry, I just lost you there.
R:	This is another thing, if you don’t have a good internet setup, it’s frustrating.  
Int:	Especially if it’s when something is already going a bit wrong or not straightforward.
R:	That’s right and I think the problem is you can rely too much on technology and if it doesn’t, if anything happens and it doesn’t work properly, you know, people get frustrated and upset.
Int:	And you don’t want that to create a fear of doing it again, trying it again.
R:	Absolutely, yeah.  
Int:	This is pretty much all my questions, was there anything else that you wanted to share or comment on in terms of how technology might be being used for loneliness and isolation?
R:	I don't think so, I think technology really has its place and it’s got an important place but I don't think anything should be in place for physical contact, whether or not it’s a voice, phone or just the sense of that you've got a friend.  Physical, social contact is important because we are social beings aren’t we?  
Int:	Yes, it’s always going to come back to that, it makes sense.  [section removed for confidentiality]
R:	Do you consider the telephone, the actual telephone to be technology as well?
Int:	Yes, that’s fine because we’re thinking about how things have been used and particularly  around the pandemic and once that face to face was not an option, anything then was a form of technology to be able to connect with people so yes, the telephone and anything else that you've got examples of is all fine, it’s all interesting for us.  
R:	I’ve got a blind lady who used telephone befriending, she doesn’t have good mobility, now we’re picking her up and bringing her to events, we’ve got some bingo going and got a volunteer who supported her but also, she’s got telephone befriending and it’s been a lifeline to her too.

[WRAP UP AND CLOSE]









					
Recording Details:		P009












Int:	To start, could you please give a brief overview of your role and of the organisation that you work for? 
R:	All of them?
Int:	Yes!  
R:	I’m a member of [name of council] which is the watchdog so to speak of the [name of board].  Each [name of board] in Wales has their own watchdog which is a group that oversees what the [name of board] are providing, collects the information from the public regarding whether their treatment and facilities that the [name of board] provide are suitable for the people.  
	We collect information, we reach out to the public, we ask the public to contact us with problems and we take problems back to the [name of board] and regular discussions with the chair of the [name of board] and various clinicians, just to make sure that they are dealing with problems in a proper manner.  
	So that’s basically my role, we used to go into hospitals and clinics to speak to patients, obviously we can’t do that anymore so the role has changed vastly but we’re still basically, sort of collecting information from the public, talking on an almost daily basis with the [name of board] to make sure that it’s a two-way thing.
	My other role is I’m on [a committee for disability]. We meet on a bi-monthly basis with different disability organisations throughout [name of city].  I sit on that in my role as [name of title] but also as an interest in disability issues within the county. Then we thrash out things that are going on for disabled people and get the right people into the meetings to discuss how we move on with those problems.  So it’s quite involved!  
	I also help to run a craft group for older adults and some of them have dementia and different health problems, mostly our people are sent to us by social prescribers as having some specific problem and need and group where they can feel part of.  So that’s basically me!  Plus I’m an old lady myself so I have that perspective as well!  
Int:	Could you tell me about the work all your organisations do with older people specifically?
R:	You want specifically the problems that we’re finding for those who are not understanding technology or not interested in technology, is that the sort of …?  
Int:	Those who are lonely and then we’re going to see how technology was used.
R:	Loneliness, obviously, through the last two years has been horrendous, not necessarily people are lonely because they live alone but often, they are lonely because they can’t identify with their own groups, with their own peers, [inaudible 00:03:54] peer groups in the younger age group but you don’t often hear it for older people and it’s just as important, that they speak and interact with people of their own age and interests, that’s something that’s often forgotten, I think.  
	Those who are older probably have health issues or mobility issues as well which exacerbates the problem.  I understand that because I’ve got arthritis and I like to walk, I like to get out there after a day on the computer, nothing better than going to the beach.   So I understand on the days that I can’t do it, just how isolating that is and how it pulls your heart whole health down, everything goes wrong, your mental health, your physical health, so I can really identify with those people who have mobility issues as well as loneliness, that’s a big problem, a huge problem.
	And then a lot of those that have dementia and other mental health issues, yes they can connect sometimes via technology but mostly they don’t, those kind of people don’t because they can’t cope with it or they’re afraid of it.  So yes, a huge problem and it’s been worse obviously over the last two years.
Int:	How does the organisations you work for, the committee on disability and the craft group, how do you help older adults through that?
R:	Through the [council], we have tried always to reach out, we do an awful lot online which is essential to reach the majority of people. We’re also very well aware that, not all of us, some people in the organisation on the [name of board] are still not cognoscente of the fact that many people are being left out, those without technology are being left out; I am very aware of it.  
	We try and reach out to them, we try and post things through doors of where we know people are alone and not getting out, we all know our local community and we post, what goes out on our website is turned into a news sheet and that goes through doors.  
	Also, we aren’t supposed to put our own personal numbers on, there’s an office number but there’s nobody in the office anymore so even that’s gone wrong, so quite often a lot of us do put our own personal number on at the moment, which we get inundated with calls, yes but hey, it’s part of what you do, it just needs to be done at the moment.  You can’t stick to rules always because people are still being left out, the rules don’t cover everything, you know?  So although we’re not supposed to do it, we often do.
	The disability issues, a lot of our people that we deal with are isolated, they’re housebound because of their disabilities. That’s always difficult, we’re not reaching out to them, we’re missing an awful lot of people, I’m quite aware of it.  We get together, we talk, we deal with problems, we reach out to people as much as we can but we’re also quite aware that it’s the tip of the iceberg, it’s very frustrating, it’s very worrying but it is what it is, we can’t reach everybody.  
	With the craft group, again some of them, one or two of them live with family so family have technology obviously and that makes it easier to contact them. Some live alone, one of two with dementia rely on again, a personal visit from us because it’s the only way, you can’t do things any other way, you can’t send them a letter because they lose it or they can’t read it, they can’t understand it.  They don’t use computers, the only thing is we have to get in the car and physically go and see them.  We’re quite aware, very, very aware, it worries me in particular that we’re missing an awful lot of people.  
Int:	If you think back to the early days of COVID19 and the first lockdown, what sorts of conversations were had in the organisation about how technology could or should be used to prevent loneliness and social isolation?
R:	Obviously, that conversation was had. I think a lot of the top organisations if you like, the [name of board] and the county council, they automatically assume that everybody’s going to do everything online and there’s people like me and others like me that say, “no, you can’t assume that, you have got to realise that not everybody’s online for various reasons”, maybe they don’t want to be, maybe they physically can’t, maybe they feel stupid and don’t want to open themselves up to ridicule – as they feel it – because they can’t cope with anything.  So we have these conversations.
	Unfortunately, two years on, those conversations are still going on because just recently, we’ve had the booster and we’ve had COVID passes and I have been dealing with numerous people on a one to one basis that can’t access any of these and they don't know what’s going on, and they don't know how to get where they want to be.  Those conversations that we had in the beginning two years ago are still happening, now it hasn’t really improved an awful lot, unfortunately.
Int:	So there are conversations about like providing access to technology or technological skills, I suppose?
R:	It can happen.  The [name of board] have given out tablets, they have given some instruction.  What they’re not understanding is to give a tablet and basic instructions to somebody who has no understanding of technology at all, you're really opening a can of worms for those people, they’re getting quite upset, they’re getting quite stressed and in case they mess something up, they can’t do it and they feel stupid.  It’s not easy.  
	It’s good to provide an iPad and to provide the technology, to provide the training rather but for an awful lot of older people and dementia people, because they can’t grasp it or they’re afraid of it or for many reasons, they won’t do it because they feel stupid.  You do hear, they hear of things going wrong like with the bank and people conning them and they're frightened of it, they’re really terrified of doing it and they just throw their hands up and say, “I don’t want to do this”, and you can’t force people to do it.  
	Giving them a laptop or giving them an iPad and giving them basic – and I do say basic – because that’s all you can do at a distance, basic skills, it really isn't always, sometimes it maybe the answer but the majority of times I find it isn't the answer because they’re too afraid.
Int:	In your opinion, what do you think could be done to help overcome these fears?
R:	The only way and it is difficult is personal health, personal supervision, one to one which at the moment is very, well the last two years, it’s been very difficult but if we want older people to really embrace this, we need to be aware that we have to hold them by the hand and physically be there as a friend to say, “you can do this and I’ll be with you every step of the way and I will help you”, you can’t just give them the stuff and say, “there you are, I’ve shown you how to logon, I’ve shown you how to open it up, it’s all yours”, that’s not enough.  
	It’s too scary, it’s like asking me to go into NASA and launch a spaceship, to them it’s exactly that, you might as well say something like that to them because it’s something they’ve never done, never had training, they’ve never even seen a computer or switched one on and if you give them basic training, you may tell them once, the next time they switch it on, if they haven’t done it for a day or so, they’re back to square one, it really doesn’t work.
Int:	When you’re having these conversations about using tech and how to use it and when not to use, what were some of the pros that were discussed in those conversations?
R:	Not many, to be honest because I find we’re still battling with those who do do it on a daily basis, to make them understand how difficult it is for those who don’t and two years on, that same conversation is still happening.
Int:	Prior to COVID, had your organisations used any technology with older adults before or did they just occur? 
R:	No, that’s occurred because we have to do it.  With the [name of board], the [name of council], we were going out into situations, health situations, GP surgeries, hospitals, clinics, care homes, we were going out to talk to people on a one to one basis and you sit there and you listen to what they have to say, you jot a few things down and take it back in a meeting and discuss it.  
	There was no need of the technology then, we were really thrown in the deep end, the office itself and the [name of board] was thrown in the deep end because they weren’t used to doing any of this so meetings and Zoom calls, it was not something we’d all done and we had to learn.  
	I’d never done Zoom calls, I’ve used a computer for years and I’d never done a Zoom call in my life, didn’t even know what it was and all of a sudden, you're chatting to this and you think, “ah, what shall I do?  I don’t understand this, I’m not going face to face with somebody I don’t know”, and we had to do it but it was not an issue before then, we had never done it.  
Int:	Can you give me some more details of the main ways you use technology in your organisation?  It could be phones or computers, anything to address loneliness and social isolation?
R:	Phones, yes, phones are a big necessity for all of us but you can’t see people’s reactions and they can’t see you, you're just a voice.  It’s limiting, essential but limited.  
	You can’t see somebody that’s suffering from depression on the other end of the phone unless they physically talk about it, which often they don’t but when you're face to face with somebody, you see depression in people’s eyes, it’s a whole different thing.  So yes, we always use the phone to contact people.  
	Now, where do I go with this?  Now we use technology, Zoom calls, Skype sometimes, it’s still limited to those who want to do it and can do it.
Int:	For those who are engaging with it and who seem to be doing it, is it successful for them? 
R:	Yes, for some people it’s amazing.  I’m not knocking it totally, for some people, many people, it’s been an absolute life line, they can actually see a friendly face and chat and often, it leads to other things as well, if they’re near you, you may meet up and go for a walk out in the fresh air, once you've seen them and they’ve chatted and you know you have a rapport, which you can’t have on the telephone, you don’t have that rapport on the telephone.  With technology, with Skype and Zoom, you do. 
	Often, you can meet up with people and go for a little walk with them, that makes a big difference to their life and it gives you more contact with them, so that’s worked in many ways, that’s been amazing.
Int:	So those who did engage, what do you think was their motivation to do so and to keep engaging?
R:	Their motivation to actually start using technology?
Int:	Yes. 
R:	The ones who started it, desperation most of them because there was no other way and they had to sort of throw themselves into it.  We have people on the committees that I sit on, members of the [name of council] who don’t, some of them are professional people, they don’t like Zoom calls, they don’t like doing their meetings on Zoom, they hate it and they can’t wait to get back meeting face to face.  
	I’m happy with it, it’s great, I don’t have to travel anywhere, I can sit in my house and chat to somebody, fine and it’s great because we have found that we get more members of the [name of board], managers, top dogs if you like, in meetings whereas before your meeting could be in [name of city] and they've got to come from [name of city], travel to [name of city], go back again, they’re busy people and they didn’t always find the time to do that so you could, sometimes we could not get these clinicians and managers to come to a meeting.  But now, they take a 10 minute out of their day to do a Zoom call so we talk to them an awful lot more than we used to, so that’s a big plus.  
	But that’s on the professional side of it, when you're talking about older people and the isolation, a lot of it hasn’t improved.  There’s been organisations such as Age Cymru, Age UK, different organisations have undertook training for people but they have got to have that start of, they’ve got to have a bit of knowledge before they can undertake any training because the training is done on the computer or the phone.  It isn't a one to one in their home so they’ve got to have a bit of understanding, a bit of savvy with technology before they can even start the training.
	I’ve had training to, everything was on my computer, my filing system on my computer was horrendous because so much info was coming in and I was not having time to process it properly, and I just could not sort it out.  So I had online training and they helped me sort out my files, devise a better system for me so that I could cope with it, that was great for me and it helped me with my work but you have to have that groundwork first before you can begin to have a computer course with any of these organisations.
Int:	Do you think using technology was more successful at reducing loneliness for certain groups of older people compared to others?  Could you see a difference between groups?
R:	Those that already could use a computer but only used it perhaps tinker about, play around, perhaps order something online, those kind of people, once they’d got into Zoom calls and face to face meetings, they progressed very quickly to really enjoying that process and their wellbeing improved and they gained confidence.  To gain confidence, you improve your feeling of wellbeing and your self-worth goes up 100-fold, which is wonderful.  
	I understand that feeling because I’ve been there, done that and I can identify with that but again, as they were only talking about people who are so afraid of it and don’t want to do whatever we [inaudible 00:21:19] , those are the ones being left out and I don't know how we can get to those.  
Int:	And did you see any individuals who started engaging and then stopped?
R:	In the hospitals, yes, I can’t think of anything [inaudible 00:21:40] in people’s homes, personally but in the hospitals, some people were given tablets on wards, they were given a basic training how to do it so they could contact their family because earlier in the pandemic, we couldn’t even see family.
	They did it as long as somebody was with them, like a member of staff was with them, they were comfortable but because of staffing shortages, because of difficulties on wards, they aren’t the people to do this so they just gave up.  So those that started with good intent gave up because there was no supervision and they weren’t happy, so that ended badly really.  
	They did try but they weren’t comfortable and we don’t have the kind of staffing that can be on wards helping people with talking to their loved ones on the computer, it’s just not going to work. 
Int:	So for the support provided, it was either by people working on wards and do you think friends and family were helping?  
R:	They couldn’t go into the hospitals so it was just the staff on the wards which, you can imagine, with the best will in the world, they don’t have time to spend with a patient, their physical needs, medical needs far outweigh sitting with them on a computer talking to their family, that’s a nice addition if you have time to do it but we find as staff shortages get worse, there’s just no time for that.
Int:	And for the older adults living at home, do you think they had support from certain people?
R:	No, I don’t actually, some had the support of their close family or friends that, if they were in a bubble with somebody, they would come in occasionally and help them, advise them and show them what to do but I often find with older people who are not technology savvy, somebody can sit and show you something and go through it for an hour, when they’ve gone and you try and do it yourself, it’s a whole different ball game.
	We found people who’d say, “my son has shown me how to do it, I can do this” but when they actually come to, like today talking to you now, I do know how to do it but it all went wrong and I had to relog into Zoom, change my password and start all over again.  If you're not technology savvy, that’s enough to just throw you and say, “the hell with it, I’m not going to bother, I can’t do this.”  
	So when it goes wrong and when it’s difficult and they don't know what they’re doing then it’s no good having somebody just come in occasionally to help, people just give up.
Int:	What effect did using technology to prevent loneliness do you think had on you and your colleagues and the work you do?
R:	Very frustrated, we’d like to do a lot more, we’re quite aware that people are slipping through the net, we think we’ve done all we can, there may be other things that we can do but I don't know, we’ve spent hours and hours in meetings thinking how we can reach the people that we know are out there, that are lonely, that are isolated, we know they’re there, it’s not easy to get to them, not at the moment.  I don't know the answer to that, we’re constantly trying to devise new ways but you're very limited.  
	In another generation, in another 20 years, this won’t be a problem because all those oldies will be gone and everybody will have had training from school and feel a lot more comfortable, but they are there now and they deserve to be helped and we find, I feel specifically, that they are not being included in a lot of things, it’s frightening, it worries me a lot, it’s one thing that I’m really concerned about and I’m banging my fist on the table so many times.  In fact, when I go to meetings, they wait for me to say something about this very subject!  
	You’re not including party who don’t have technology, how do you expect them to know what you're talking about now?  You've just discussed something, you're putting it online for those that are online, how do you expect the others to do it?  They think, “she’s here again, she’s on the old hobby horse again”, it’s something I am so aware of and it really upsets me, that they don't think about it. 
	You’ll have grown up with technology, when you think “I’ll do something”, you do it on the computer, it goes out there.  It takes people sometimes a long time to realise that there are other people out there that are just not getting this.  
	I don't know what the answer is, we’ve gone round in circles. I go knocking on doors in my neighbourhood where I know people who are alone, where I know they haven’t got technology, to see if I can help them, that’s great but it’s a drop in the ocean, something more needs to be done and I don't know the answer, I wish I did.
Int:	You've discussed a couple throughout this whole conversation but what do you think were some unexpected positive and negative effects that were found after implementing technology?
R:	Positive effects?  I do think after all the discussions post COVID, throughout COVID, all the discussions with the [name of board], with the county councils, I think we have made them aware that they need to do this multidisciplinary, whatever they need to do, it has to be multidisciplinary, it doesn’t have to be a message on the internet and I think we have, I think we’ve finally got through there, they are trying but they don’t see another way sometimes, I can see that they can’t see another way of doing it. 
	I would think that at one time, you'd read the paper, you'd buy the paper and read everything that was going on locally or nationally, people don’t buy newspapers anymore, especially those who can’t get out for medical reasons, they can’t get out and buy a newspaper so they don’t get it that way.
	I think we should spend more money, this my feeling and I have said it in meetings, on delivering things through people’s front doors.  We do it when there’s an election and they want your vote.  We do it for national things that we need everybody to know, your voting slip is posted through your door, it used to be, again that is online but we should spend more time and money on delivery through doors, then you reach everybody.
Int:	When you're talking about delivering things, do you mean information as well?
R:	Yes, I think all the information that people need, COVID awareness should not have been just online or via the television screen, it should have been posted in people’s doors like where you go for your injections, where you go for your boosters, how you get a COVID pass, it should all be coming through every single door so that no matter whether you're on technology or not, you're still included in what’s going on.  
	Everybody’s got a front door, a door to their flat, their house, wherever they live, a caravan, they’ve still got a door, you should be able to have things posted through your door with all this information on.  I know it’s expensive but we do it if we need to for other reasons and in Wales, we waste an awful lot of money on doing everything bilingually and half of that paper goes in the bin because people don’t want it bilingual, they either want Welsh or they want English, the money we’re wasting on that is colossal.  That angers me when they say they haven’t got the money to do postal drops for people who aren’t on technology or people who are disabled or sick, the money’s being spent in the wrong place, I think the only way at the moment – this isn't going to go on forever, maybe only as long as the people who have never had a computer in their life are still alive.  
	For now, I think we ought to think more about these people and include them - and disabled people – we have lots of rules about disability and inclusivity but it really isn't happening.  
Int:	In your survey response, you said you anticipate the balance of face to face and remote work to be mostly remote actually, how do you think that’s going to work?  
R:	For the foreseeable future, obviously, some of our people would like a mixture, they would like to have face to face and then computer links for those who don’t want to come to the meetings physically or can’t come to the meetings physically, technologically that’s more difficult and I’m not sure even our organisation is able to provide that because we’ve been feeling our way all through this.  
	We’ve got better at it but a mixture of face to face and technology at meetings is a little more complicated, so I don't know whether that is something that’s going to happen but for the moment, we are sticking, we’ve all decided, the council and the [name of board] have decided that remote meetings are the way for now.
	Some of our people have just stayed away, they don’t want to do it, which is their choice, it’s up to them, it’s a shame but it is what it is, it’s difficult times, it’s very difficult times, you can’t force people to go to meetings if they don’t feel comfortable, you can’t force meetings.  
	I don’t drive, I use public transport or I walk everywhere, I’m not happy using public transport at the moment because not everybody wears a facemask, so I’m happy the way things are at the moment, some are not, you can’t please everybody, we’ve just got to do our best in a difficult situation.   
Int:	What kind of help could be given or what do you need to be able to make remote working better or the mix of remote and face to face working?  
R:	More help, I would think, from organisations that can train us into this dual fuel way of meeting, equipment as well is often expensive and hard to come by.  If we went into face to face meetings, some of the rooms that we use, it wouldn’t be our own office because it’s too small, it wouldn’t be safe, it would have to be a community room, that doesn’t lend itself to dual type of meeting, you'd have to have a screen, speakers, they’re just huge community rooms that we hire sometimes for meetings and I don't think a dual way of working would work in that aspect, neither do most of our managers and directors.  
	They are sticking with the way we are at the moment because moving forward to a dual way of working is going to be mostly and more difficult, and they don’t have the time or equipment to do it to be honest, shoestring budgets as usual!  
Int:	Do you plan to do any type of formal evaluation of loneliness and social isolation of your service users and the use of technology?  
R:	We have been doing that, we have been doing surveys for quite a while now, there are surveys gone out, if you're interested, I can send you things like that, the survey that we have sent out?
Int:	What kind of questions does it ask overall?
R:	Questions are, “Would you be happy to use technology?”, “Do you have access to technology?”, “Do you have any help, if you wanted to do it, would you be able to have a family member or somebody help you, to teach you how to do it?”, yes, some people have come back and said, “I’ll try because I can see this is going on a long time and I need to up my game and I’d like to” and they’ve got family members.  
	I think more and more people have come on board over the last two years, if this had gone on for six months, we wouldn’t have seen a change but I think because it’s gone on for two years now, we have seen more and more people try and more and more families try and get their elderly relatives onto computers because that’s the only way they can talk to them.  So it has improved but there is still the big factor that we’re missing out.
	We have done surveys by post, things in newspapers but we don’t find newspapers very good, again most of them are online aren’t they, they don’t seem to want to help us very much.  We’ve battled an awful lot, there’s only one newspaper which I think is in [name of city]?  Down west anyway, they work with the [name] very well and all that we put online or through doors, they will put in the newspaper as well but they’re the only one, nobody else is interested in doing it and I don't know why that is, we don’t seem to have a very good rapport with newspapers.
Int:	Do you get a lot of responses back from your surveys?
R:	Yes, quite a lot, it’s quite good.  We have surveys on lots of different things, there’s one recently gone out on the maternity and birth and how people have found that experience and that has really returned a lot, that was really good. 
	One survey has gone out recently on GP access and how people, whether people can or cannot get appointments easily and how the doctors have been coping with attendances, and that was quite a good survey.  
	As you can imagine, a survey on technology and “Do you use technology?”, only comes back from those who do, it obviously doesn’t come back from those that don’t so you're still not finding out how many you're missing, we know they’re there.  
	Some of us live in towns, some of us live in rural areas so we all go out into our communities since we can’t go into hospitals, we’ve gone out more into our community and we all know there are people on our doorstep that are totally isolated, don’t see anybody, don’t use a computer, we all know they’re there but if you send a survey out, you only get that survey back from those who have seen it and the ones we put through doors get answered, the ones we put through technology get answered, how do you reach the others?  
Int:	A good question!  
R:	It is a good question, it’s a big question, throughout the three organisations that I work with, we have tried to address this and we’ve made some in-roads but we know there’s a big factor out there.  I have had people knock on my door, “Can you get me a COVID pass?  I don’t have a computer and I’d like to go out for a meal for Christmas with my friends”, they need a COVID pass.  “I need my booster injection and I don't know how to get there because I don’t drive, so how can I get there?”, so I have  badgered and I have sworn at and I have got very angry with the [name of board] for putting our booster station out where there isn't a bus service, and they haven’t put a bus on.
	I got my MP, [name], on board and together we have bombarded them with questions and really harangued them and she’s helped enormously.  Now they’ve put a bus on.  So that worked but you've really got to sort of, “you’ve got to do this”, you know?  
	Those that didn’t have computers, how are they going to find the information of how to get there?  “They can get a taxi”.  No, they can’t get a taxi, you can’t always rely on a taxi.  If you need to go for your booster in the morning or afternoon when schools are going in and out, you won’t get a taxi, they aren’t available, they’re all doing school runs, so it really limits the fact that when you get a taxi, you don’t have a car, there is no bus out there, how the hell do you go and get your booster?  
	If you're online, you can ask questions, you can send emails, I’ve sent about 10,000 emails to the [name of board] asking them, “How does this person do this?  How does this person do that?” and eventually it’s come back and they’ve seen this isn't working and they have changed things.  But I had to go to my MP and together, we have fought tooth and nail to get this bus put on.  And now, if that bus isn't used fully, it will be taken off but they’re not telling people how to use it or where it goes or what time, only online.  So if you're not online, you don't know that bus is there or what time it goes.  You're back to square one, if the bus isn't used by those who need it, then they’ll take it off.  Same old story, information is not getting out to everybody.  
Int:	Thank you very much, that was all my questions, it was very insightful to hear your perspective.  [section removed for confidentiality, interviewer talks about the concept of loneliness and technology]
R:	[sentence removed for confidentiality]  It has helped in certain circumstances but I still don't think we’ve got it right and I think we’re missing an awful lot of people.  The very fact that people’s mental health is poor at the moment, especially older people and very young people, I don't know why because they’re on technology, maybe the pressure on them is huge but older people have no access to any help if they’re experiencing mental difficulties, if they’re not on a computer and can talk to people, I don't know what the heck they’re doing, it terrifies me because we’re missing an awful lot.
	I honestly think things through letterboxes should be compulsory, if it’s important enough to be online, for everybody to access, it’s important enough to stick a note through somebody’s door with the same information.  
Int:	[section removed for confidentiality, interviewer discusses the topic of reaching older adults]
R:	You could talk to people like me, I use technology, I’m out there doing it but I speak to neighbours who don’t have technology, don’t have computers, wouldn’t the foggiest idea and don’t really want to because they’re scared of it.  I talk to these people all the time and if they have a problem or need to know something, they’ll come and ask me to find out on the internet.  It’s only through me that they will do it.  
	We need to be aware and I keep saying this to everybody, the [name of board], the council, the MPs, I talk to them all!  I’ve spoken to [name], all the time I am battering on about “You're missing people out, what are you going to do about it?”, from their perspective, the screen in there in front of them, they won’t see it because what they want to put out there, they do on computers. They’re not seeing it and it frustrates the hell out of me, to be honest!  
Int:	[section removed for confidentiality] Thank you.

Recording Details:		P008
	












Int:	To start, could you please give a brief overview of your role and the organisation that you work for?
R:	I’m [job title] of a charity called [name of organisation], before the pandemic, we would be a charity that goes into care homes, community spaces, libraries and hubs, singing with the elderly, not always just the elderly, adults with learning difficulties as well, trying to alleviate isolation and loneliness through the joy of music and singing.  
Int:	Could you tell me about the work that your organisation does with older people specifically?
R:	With older people specifically, I’m going to talk in two sections, one is to do with my online work which is obviously relevant to what we’re talking about and obviously, the whole setup originally of the charity and what its reasoning was.
	The idea is to try and help to alleviate loneliness and isolation in older people, the music and the singing is really the catalyst to bring people together, we’re not a choir, we’re definitely not a charity that is seen to be harmonising or anything like that, it’s really just the act of coming in the room and singing and sharing a common interest with older people.  So music that they’re very familiar with and a chance of them to get to meet old friends and new friends, so that’s the real remit, to get people out of the front door and to come to a familiar social setting and to feel comfortable and engaged for an hour. 
Int:	How does this work differ, the work with the older adults, from the work with the other populations, you said people with learning difficulties, do you work differently?
R:	We work in a lot of different ways, we have some sessions that we call “closed sessions” where we go into a centre say for example, day centre, with specifically adults with learning difficulties and also people with dementia.  The difference is that some people don’t really feel the need or can’t access the book that we provide, so it’s very much more of a, with adults with learning difficulties often just dancing, movement and things like that, it’s not so much the singing.  That’s the main difference.
	But also, we have a lot of groups that are integrated, we don’t close our doors off to anyone, we don’t say it’s only for older people, it’s only for people with learning difficulties, what we do is say it’s open and inclusive to everybody.  Often, we find that a lot of people take adults with learning difficulties under their wing and they will form a friendship and that’s the sort of lovely thing that organically happens within our sessions. 
Int:	So you said there’s a big focus on preventing loneliness and social isolation, from what you've seen, which groups do you think are most affected by this?
R:	I think because historically, a lot of older people will talk to you about their emotions and how they feel, we often get a lot of feedback from them directly saying, “I was bereaved, I didn’t have any friends and I came here and everything’s changed”, and those lovely stories that we hear of people and their lives changing drastically after using our [name of organisation] sessions is very humbling to us.  But it is definitely evidence that those are the sorts of things that happen so it’s often bereaved people that have lost a very close member of their family, that reach out to [name of organisation] to come and use our facilities.  
	Often, it’s somebody cajoling a friend to say, “Look, you should come to this” and they’ll say, “I can’t sing” and we’ll say, “that really is irrelevant, it’s not about that”.  So very often, I would say it’s the older population that benefit the most.  
Int:	If you think back to the early days of COVID19, what sorts of conversations were had in your organisation about how digital technology could or should be used to prevent loneliness and social isolation?
R:	This is a really interesting question for us because my colleague and I, my colleague’s a lot younger than me and is more tech savvy, we sat in the car on the phone, I remember the conversation and it was basically, “What on earth are we going to do?  These people are going to be stuck in their homes with very little to keep them occupied” and we know for certain that isolation and loneliness has a detrimental mental health effect. 
	So we just said, “We’ve got to do something”, so we started to cobble together a very basic, almost Facebook singing session that a lot of the younger people would forward on or share with their oldest family members, to which extent, it grew and grew to now, we have a really nice streamlined, effective, twice a week singing session for older people with the lyrics coming up for them in big print, and we go straight into smart TVs in care homes and community centres so that people can enjoy that.
	We also offer things like one to one sessions, for example, we have a lady with learning difficulties, she’ll have a one to one Zoom session with us, a shorter session but her one favourite song so that she can actually access that as well, so we’ve tried to be really creative and gosh, it’s been a steep learning curve for an older people like myself to learn all the technology but it really has been beneficial and I’m amazed by how many older people have been able to use technology, it’s actually a real eye opener, so very positive. 
Int:	So you had a conversation with your colleague, did you have a choice on what or how technology was going to be used or was there some type of mandation from high above?
R:	What happened was our boss saw what we were trying to do, we got some funding from various organisations to help us which was incredible.  We had a guy that came into do the lyrics for us because we knew how important it was for people to read as they’re singing.  We had a lot of help and input from lots of other organisations and I think that all those sorts of things helped us to empower older people to use our, they knew that it was going to be a worthwhile hour if they could access it somehow, so they were getting family members and for example, community coordinators were helping groups, going into their homes in full PPE and setting up their computers for them so they could access the weekly [name of organisation] session because they didn’t want to miss it.   Sometimes, they’d know their friends were watching as well, it was an online community feel about it and still is very much so.  
Int:	When you were discussing the use of Zoom or whatnot, what do you think were the pros and cons of using technology to prevent loneliness?
R:	I think the pros outweigh the cons, definitely because I was very fearful of using Zoom, I used to feel that if I was using Zoom, I wasn’t concentrating on what my real job was which was to engage older people, to communicate with them in a very positive manner, I was worried that would be put to the side, where I’d be concentrating on, “Have I taken mute off?” and those sorts of things.
	But I think that with a great support of colleagues and things like that, we all worked together very well, it was a very positive thing and the feedback we get via emails are very positive.  We’re very reactive now so if somebody says, “I really liked that session last week”, we’ll email them back and say, “What songs would you like?”  So the following week, it’ll be “here’s a little shout out for so and so” and it makes them feel, some of the feedback’s been they feel like they’re in a session, even though they’re sitting their lounge, “they’re talking to me”, I’ll go “Hi [name], how are you? What are you up to?” and that’s the sort of feel where as fabricated as it is, it’s good to have a little feeling of, “wow, this is actually a real [name of organisation] session”.  
Int:	Feels more personal to be able to call out and shout out.
R:	Yes, exactly.  
Int:	When you decided to use tech, was access to hardware and software discussed or data security?
R:	Yes, quite a few of my colleagues went on various courses to learn all the different bits and pieces, I can’t honestly say that that was me, I was very much the one who was going, “keep on delivering the [name of organisation] sessions”.  We had the software and the hardware and we were able to access stuff, we had to go up in quality with all our recording equipment and things like that, that had to be improved because initially it was just on a phone and standing there holding it, so we had to get a lot of equipment in and we had to talk about GDPR, obviously as a charity we have to be very aware of that and sometimes, we do things like online Zoom sessions within a bigger group so for example, in [name of city], we do a lot with independent living and things like that and so we wouldn’t access these, we couldn’t see the people that we were talking to, we couldn’t see into their homes, they could only see us, so there was a lot of caution around security for older people as well.  
Int:	You said you bought some equipment, what did you buy and how did you go about figuring out what you needed?  Was it trial and error?  Or how did it go?
R:	The charity has worked with a sort of tech guy over the years that has done different filming I think for them, on a bigger scale. So we contacted him and asked him to help us completely with our charity and what we do and we got some funding in for that, specifically for that and he advised us about what equipment we would need. We needed to get a tripod, a decent phone for filming, computers that we were able to upload more swiftly where each, because we do two sessions a week, it’s quite a high turnover. And as I say, we had to have training for Zoom and things like that so yes, equipment wise, we had to go up a notch, we couldn’t get away with what we had, we couldn’t botch it anymore really!  
Int:	Had you tried any tech previously with older adults that hadn’t worked?
R:	No, this is the interesting thing because our job previously had always just been to go into these community hubs and libraries and just to work with them, with books in your hands and nobody had ever discussed or got to grips with technology.  
	But incredibly, amazed at how many people are responding to us online and they’re on You Tube, they’re saying, “we had such a great session with you, can we play this next week?” and honestly, I genuinely think it’s been a bit of a lifeline for people, not everybody because I spoke to a lady yesterday on the phone and she said, “No, I only have a landline, I can’t watch you online” and then I start to think more about how we can help those people that are really, really isolated, so we’ve got a little CD together of the songs that [name of colleague], my colleague and I do the sessions and [name of colleague] has created a CD of music and so our next process is to actually manually send these CDs to people that have absolutely no internet access and aren’t really able to do it or don’t want to, that feel again a part of the charity’s, we’re here, we’re singing with you, we’re joining in with you.  
	So we’ve got to think this year, to really think about some of those people that are not accessing anything and there are people out there. My example is my mum’s 87 and she’s the WhatsApp guru and it’s great, “I watched the session last week”. It’s fantastic because I think she would never have done that and I know that’s the example we’re using, is people that can genuinely now – and they're quick off the mark – they know what they’re doing, it’s incredible, so it’s a lesson to me because they are teaching me something!  If they can do it, I have to do it.   
Int:	Roughly, what do you think is the proportion of people who couldn’t have access to these online sessions and to whom you're going to be sending CDs, that might have been left behind from the lack of tech? 
R:	This is a really new area, it’s something we’ve only started talking about in the last couple of days and I think that I’m trying to get underneath who these people are.  Again, we’ve got issues with addresses, what information we have, if they phone me and say, “When’s [name of organisation] coming back?” and I can say to them, “Look, we do have a CD, if you're really out of touch, would you like one?”, then that will be the way we work.  
	Statistically, I don’t have yet any information about that but I kind of know there’s a good 25% that have dropped off and sadly, a couple of months ago, I did a one to one Zoom session for a lady who has dementia and when I started to do it with her, I realised that she used to be in one of our sessions and her mental health had really deteriorated since the last time we saw her, and she didn’t know who I was.  But we accessed her via the hospital [name of organisation], we got access to singing with her and that again in itself was wonderful, she didn’t know us but she knew the songs which was wonderful.  Just got to find them!  
Int:	That’s what’s hardest, to find those who maybe more isolated without the tech.  
	Are there any service users who tried using the technology, who tried joining those Zoom sessions that then stopped?  
R:	I don't think so, what’s happened is there’s been a lovely unseen support network, if somebody’s tried to use it, they’ve then got back to somebody such as a community coordinator something and said, “I’m having trouble” and then they’ve been helped.  I don't know of anybody who’s actually used it and then stopped using it, most people that have got on board with it have actually stuck with it and actually got onto other sessions, they’ll do a singing session, then some exercise session or there’s another lovely one which is supporting memories, there’s a lovely link there, so people will go and do a few and make it part of their day, I suppose.
Int:	In the care homes, who was setting up the live streaming on the TV, was it the people who worked there?
R:	Yeah, definitely the carers, they’re so progressive, they were fantastic because a lot of the time we do care homes, we just don’t do care homes but we do them and I’ve always found that the carers are the ones who are dancing in the aisles first anyway, and they love it because they know that the people that are living there will have an hour of complete fun and it’s okay to get up and move if you want to, you don’t just have to stay in the chair, the music that we have is really upbeat, lively music, it’s not depressing, it’s the Beatles, Abba, Cliff Richard, everybody wants to get up and move so that in itself in the care homes is a real plus because it gives the carers of full on entertainment and we do stream straight to them, and we can do independent ones just for the care homes.  We can even say, “It’s so and so’s birthday today, happy birthday to you, what are you doing today?”, if we’re having a Zoom session, it’s very much an ongoing conversation rather than just them sitting and listening to us.  
Int:	How often would you say you do some independent sessions, one to one?
R:	Christmas time is really busy, always is, so we did about 12 sessions over Christmas but usually in the month, about four or five.  Again, looking to build that up because mask wearing and restrictions are still in Wales and [name of organisation] aren’t going back any time soon, so we need to ensure that we’re doing more – and actually, that’s exactly what we’re working on this week, touching care homes, getting into care homes that are near to the sessions that have previously run, so that they can have a little taste of what we’re up to and then if they want to and they’re able to, they can actually move into a face to face group when we go back, so yeah, that’s the work we’re doing at the moment.  
Int:	One issue we know to usually be a barrier for some older adults is that the fear of using technology, either due to not wanting to break devices or being afraid of internet scams or things like that, was that an issue for the older adults you worked with?
R:	What was really useful for us if we had a lot of people such as, there was one in [name of city] and he was running an operation that they were giving older people free tablets and helping them to have really basic, “just click this button and do this and you can watch this”, and I think we had a lot of people on the coalface doing a lot of those different things, I think I said community coordinators, things like that, which was really helpful.    
	So that was in itself really good but I think for us, what we were seeing was our online sessions were very clear, “just click on this because it’s really simple”, you just go to our website and you click on this link and it all just comes up so there’s really nothing much to do, and I think once people had done it once and knew it was only twice a week at 11 o clock, they would just sit down and go, “Have I just got to click that button and then it will all come up?”, there didn’t seem to be too much of a worry.  
	We didn’t get feedback that there were. Feedback was great because it would be things like, “can you make the letters on the book a little bit bigger because we couldn’t read it”, maybe they were looking at it on a small screen or something, “Can the sound be altered?”, so we’d work with the sound, we changed, “Is that better?  Does it sound better this way?”, so yeah, I think everybody that had wanted to express things, were able to do that and it worked quite well.  
Int:	When you get feedback, is it at the end of a session?  Or do they send an email, do they call you?  How does that work?
R:	Lots of different ways really, so you can access the singing session on You Tube, we’d have lots of comments on You Tube that way. I would have emails sent to me, very often I’d have a care home that would send an email and they’d say, “We loved the session, next month it’s so and so’s birthday, so and so’s anniversary” and I’d have a list and then we’d deliver that out, “[name], are you sitting in your chair? I can see you, happy birthday to you”, or something like that.  
	Feedback wise, we’d ask for general criticism comments, anything like that.  We’ve not really done a formal questionnaire as such at this point but yeah, it would always be email or text or phone call, a lot of older people like to phone and have a chat about it, lots of different ways.
Int:	What effect do you think using technology in this way had on you and your colleagues?
R:	It’s forced me into the 21st Century!  I bridge the gap, sometimes I do England  and sometimes I do Wales, I’m Wales based but sometimes I nip over to England to have a look at what’s going on there, so currently I’m looking at different ways to deliver the face to face sessions in the future, which is projecting the words up onto the wall so that’s technology wise, that’s really interesting for us as a charity.  
	Yes, I saw my boss a couple of weeks ago, the first time I’d seen him for nearly two years because it’s all been Zoom meetings, I think it’s been incredible, it’s changed the way, I mean obviously there’s some terrible negative things to it but there are some really good positive things to it.  It’s changed the way we work forever, for us, colleagues, it’s given us access, lots of care homes have come to us rather than us going out.
	I had a conversation this morning with my colleague saying it’s really hard sometimes to get into a care home and speak to someone and say, “We’re not looking for anything, we just want to tell you, this free service is available and a lot of your residents might really like it”, but people, like the gatekeepers have a fear of us, “What do you want?”, and so it’s really hard to get through that.  
	But we found with the technology and they can just access online and have a look at one of our [name of organisation] live singing sessions, people are coming to us and saying, “We like what you're doing, how can we work with you?”, so in that respect it’s been incredibly useful, very much so.  
Int:	And now, it sounds like you're getting more comfortable with technology and that perhaps you're implementing it in face to face as well by having a projector showing something like that, so do you think you're more likely to implement technology even if it goes back to face to face?
R:	Yes, definitely. One of the things we’re looking at is the potential to continue on the [name of organisation] live singing sessions online as well as face to face, we’ve realised that horrific weather, doctors appointments, extreme illness prevent people from coming to the group and they feel like they’re missing out.  Sometimes, when we were face to face, someone might not be at a group for three or four months because they’ve been really unwell but now, we can say to them, “you can still go online and see us, you can still chat with us if you want to a request or for us to give you a shout out, we can do that”, so yes, 100% technology is a big, big way forward for us as a charity and we’ll be forever now, I think and like we say, about the screens and so that reduces the amount of equipment we have to carry around, we’d have to carry around 20 or 30 books sometimes to various sessions, now we take a little thing and a speaker and everything will be much easier.  It will be a bit of a learning curve but I genuinely think it’s definitely going to be worth it.
Int:	What do you think would be needed to make using both the face to face and remote delivery successful for both you and the service user?
R:	The bottom line is for me personally, for people to be a little bit more open and ready to try something different because like I said, sometimes it’s the other organisations that are the gatekeepers to accessing some really, really fantastic stuff, to just take older people out of themselves for an hour, to be nostalgic about beautiful music that they loved when they were younger and to have some sort of dialogue about that.  It’s precious, it’s really precious and for some people to say, “no, it’s not for us”, I feel frustrated because it actually is, it’s just such an easy thing and it’s so easy to access so I think for the charity, that’s the frustration and for the service users, I think in all honesty, a lot of people and the conversations I have on the phone is they want to be face to face, they miss, it’s a very physical session, there’s a lot of laughter, you cannot possibly create that online, I would love you come one day when we’re back face to face, it’s funny, it’s entertaining, there’s some real characters and it’s the highlight of their week, month, whatever and I think that’s the thing that people really do miss, it’s not so much the singing, it’s the conversations that are taking place while we’re singing and chatting.  
Int:	Do you think there are some unexpected positive effects to using digital technology, as well as some unexpected negative effects?
R:	I think probably the positive effects are that people, well I think mentioned it before is that people feel empowered to go and use it for other reasons as well, they may think “I can do this for [name of organisation] so what other groups are there that I can log onto and use?”, what other services are there, the potential is endless really, a lot of people I know have book clubs, reading clubs  and things like that.
	I think the negative is getting out, health and wellbeing is that it’s too easy and I don’t just speak for older people, I think our whole country, the world becomes more insular and you think you can conduct your life on a screen and fresh air and walking and nature and just being outdoors is as important as social interaction and I think that’s also, what we introduced about six months ago was twice a month, we do movement and music so we have our [name of organisation] songs on but also beautiful chair based movement, so that people are actually exercising as well, not just sitting on the sofa all day, they’re actually doing some exercises, so we bring in our kitchen chair and we do some stretching and things like that.  
	It’s not just me sitting there, we bring somebody in specifically who is trained to do that with older people in mind and with the right movements and the different muscle groups being used. But I think that might be the downside, technology can sometimes overwhelm us can’t it?
Int:	So you have singing classes, you have singing and movement classes, are there other types of classes/sessions you also have?
R:	We have Welsh speaking. The first Monday of every month, we have a Welsh speaking session and again, with the lyrics coming up and [name of colleague] has been running that since St David’s Day, we launched it at St David’s Day, she’s been going for almost a year, which met again with a good reception and she will take some of the real lovely classic folk songs, Welsh folk songs and do that.
	We’ve also done some lovely Bollywood, before lockdown, our very last session was a Bollywood [name of organisation] session which was fantastic and so we invited [name] to continue doing those with us online, teaching dance movements through [name of organisation] as well, so we’ve tried very hard to be as creative as we possibly can be, so it’s not the same thing every week and each week we have a different theme, seasonal or something we’ve decided to challenge and look at, we try and keep it as fresh as possible.   
Int:	Since you're going to use a bit of tech still in the future because it hasn’t faded out yet, do you plan on having any formal evaluation or loneliness and social isolation of the service users and the technology they’re using?
R:	It’s really interesting because just before lockdown, we did a survey and a university research project about loneliness and isolation, it was all done with our service users as in face to face, we didn’t know what was around the corner.  But I think it’s probably a very good idea to look into that and find out who’s been using it, how it’s been accessed and whether it would be useful for them to continue because it’s useful for us to know if it’s worth us continuing with the online sessions.  I’m sensing it really is but it would be useful, although a lot of older people do not like questionnaires!  It has to be done but they just don’t want to fill them in and I have to sit with them and go, “come on, you've got to fill these in, we need your input”, that’s why I’m doing this with you, it’s so important to get information from people, people don’t have the time or they just don’t want to do it so it is important and we try and keep the questionnaires as short as possible and just to answer their questions but yeah, it would be really useful and I think we probably would.  
Int:	That was pretty much all of my questions so thank you very much for all the information.  Is there anything else you'd like to share, another example or story that pops to mind?
R:	I don't think so, I just think talking to you makes me remember, there were so many people, when we first started doing the online sessions, we had so many people coming out of the woodwork saying, “It’s me, I’m here, I’m online” and they were so excited about, “I can see you and it feels like you're in my lounge” and it kept us going because we were thinking, “are we just flogging a dead horse here?  Is nobody watching?  Is it going to be fruitful?” and then knowing that people were just saying, “I’ve got so and so to go online, she’s coming on tomorrow, she’s going to watch it as well” and I just think it did help at a very difficult time and I’m glad that we did it, and I want to carry on going just because of that, because you know someone out there is sitting there watching it and having a laugh and we never take ourselves seriously, that’s the other funny thing, it’s really quite a good laugh and I think people love that, quite happy to take the mick out of ourselves.  
Int:	Thank you very much.  [section removed for confidentiality]
Int:	When you said you have some people who try it once and they don’t want to do it anymore, do you know why they don’t want to?
R:	It’s not that they don’t want to do [name of organisation] anymore, they don’t always want to participate in a, sometimes we ask for feedback or what they think or we want to use something they’ve said as a quote for us for funding, they do it a little bit and they just don’t want to do that part and I think because they’re probably just older and they want to enjoy what they’re enjoying, they don’t want to evidence it or think about why they’re enjoying it and that’s a hard thing for us because we’re going “Why did you enjoy it?  Tell us more about it”, it’s difficult but sometimes people just go, “I just want to enjoy it and that’s it.”

Int:	The organisation that you work for.
R:	The organisation that I work for is the [name of organisation], which is basically part of the [name] in Wales underneath the [name].  So we work with the health board and the council, and we help organisations improve people’s lives, third sector organisations.  As part of that we’ve got a befriending service which supports people over the age of 50 who are lonely, isolated and vulnerable in any way.  It’s a befriending service.  My role came about because of the pandemic when I was appointed to be a [job title] to improve connection basically and reduce social isolation through the use of technology.  And that post came into being in October last year.
Int:	Perfect, well my next question was going to be about how much focus is there on preventing loneliness and isolation, but it sounds like that’s exactly what you’re employed for.  So your job only came about as part of the pandemic then.
R:	Yeah, the befriending service existed.  It’s existed for years and it existed before the pandemic.  But before the pandemic the befriending service was a face to face service.  They ran groups that people could go out to, like a coffee morning or lunches, knit and natter groups, Men’s Sheds, all of that kind of thing.  It was all in person and our clients had befrienders who went to see them, and had chats and visits.  So it was very much a face to face friendship, companionship, reducing loneliness and isolation in person.  But obviously when the pandemic hit in March 2020 none of that was possible, it couldn’t continue.  So all of a sudden you had a lot of people who were not able to access that service anymore.  So the first thing that happened was that the service went to telephone befriending.
	So a lot of people got phone calls instead of their face to face.  But we realised that another way of reaching out to people would be through technology to have digital befrienders, to enable people to access Zoom or Google Meet to join groups online.  So there a lot of people who were missing out.  So my role was basically brought in to set that service up.
Int:	So the use of the telephone was the first instant response, and obviously things happened so quickly didn’t they?  So when you then started to look at the more technology side of it and what other options there were, you mentioned then about Zoom and Google and things like that.  So what were some of the main ways that you found different types of hardware or software that were successful for you to put out there?
R:	That was really difficult because there was a huge shortage.  We couldn’t get any hardware at all.  I know our library service had 100 iPads actually on order but it was delayed and they couldn’t get them.  So actually we couldn’t do anything with helping people access new hardware.  We had to work with the people who already had access to digital services.  Which was a shame really because we could have reached so many more people if we could have got our hands on iPads or something that was available for people.  But we didn’t, so that was a bit of a restriction really.
Int:	And so then being left with the people who did have something already in place.  Obviously we’re looking at older adults and those who are more lonely and isolated as well.  But was there particular groups of people that you could notice already had the technology in place?
R:	Some people did.  I don’t know if there was any similarities between them.  The majority of them were female.  We only had one male who accessed the groups, and it seemed to be females predominantly who came and joined us, which is the only thing I can really say that we noticed.  Some of them had family that could help them, some of them didn’t.  So it was just luck of the draw.  And we tried to reach out to everybody really just to see whether they wanted to come to the service.  But the take-up was quite small, it was quite a low take-up.
Int:	Why do you think that was then?
R:	I don’t know if it was resistance to change.  People not wanting to do that.  People wanting things as it used to be.  People being a bit dubious about technology and safety online as well.  I think that was a concern.  And actually it was a really steep learning curve and it was interesting to experience it ourselves.  I think there was a nervousness as well about going online and a fear of the unknown.  If you walk into a room in a face to face situation you can slide in unannounced.  You can gauge the feel of the place and just slip in and find your feet a bit.  But when you’re going onto an online meeting you’re there and it’s instant, and if you mess up everybody sees straightaway.  And I think there was a lot of fear and uncertainty around that as well, which people didn’t like to say I don’t think.
	I don’t think anybody came out and said that directly, but I think that was probably an issue as well.  And I think people weren’t sure how to use the technology, and it was just lots of things like that.  And it was just trying to overcome that and almost hand-holding through the process of joining and getting people to join, which took a lot more work than we thought it would actually.
Int:	I was just going to ask, so on that what kinds of things were you doing, what strategies did you have to help people overcome some of those fears or worries?
R:	Well the plan was, part of the project was to recruit digital befrienders, to train digital befrienders who would then buddy up with people and help them through the process.  But obviously those people couldn’t go out and meet people in person to talk them through the process or to show them how to do things.  So they already had to have some tech savviness basically already.  And sometimes it has hard to recruit people to do that as well because we found that because of the demographics of the volunteers as well some of them weren’t very confident, and some of them weren’t sure about showing people.  I think they were saying “what if I show them how to do something and they got it wrong, or what if I didn’t know something?”  We put some training on.
	We worked closely with [a digitally focused organisation] and did a six week training course training people how to be digital companions and how to support people.  And a lot of that was about confidence as well and confidence building.  But even at the end of that process there were still people “oh I don’t know, I don’t know if I can do it, I don’t know if I’ve got the confidence”.  “What if I don’t know something?”  I just said “it’s not about knowing everything, in fact if you don’t know something and you can work through it with the person that you’re working with, it’s a learning curve for both of you and it shows them that you don’t have to know everything”.  “And if things go wrong it’s easily fixed”.  “It’s better to be able to do that almost, rather than to be someone who’s really tech savvy and really slick and knows what to do”.
	And I was doing that remotely as well.  It’s not like I could see them to instil that confidence.  So it was all remote and you just lose something remotely in supporting people.  So we had a small handful of people.  We were lucky that the [name of university] came onboard with their second years.  They were doing a health and social care course, so they needed to do their placements.  But because they couldn’t do their placements in person they had to find a remote way of doing it.  So we had a small handful of them who were confident and tech savvy, maybe a bit younger than our other volunteers, and they made a big difference.  They came online and really helped people, so that was good.  Those were some of the challenges that we faced with it.
Int:	It’s interesting isn’t it, because what you’re saying, the response to provide the service for the older adults, but then needing to actually put the work in with the volunteers in the first place as well.  It’s a bit of a chain reaction isn’t it I suppose?
R:	Yeah, it’s a lot to set up from scratch as well and to help people.  But we did it, and we did help a small handful of people, and we did have some digital befrienders.  And we worked with local groups and we worked with national groups to Wales as well, and we ran some really successful sessions and people got a lot from them.  By the summer we were having regular attendees, a small number of regular attendees at our groups who really found the benefit of connecting online and coming to them.  
Int:	So was that the main way that technology was being used then, it was putting the groups online?  Was that the main service?
R:	Yeah, that’s how it evolved.  The idea was to actually use the befrienders to support people to access technology and become more confident.  But it was also that we could create online groups for people to come and join.  We had regular coffee mornings, we had regular lunches, bring your own lunch and we all had our lunch and shared things.  What else did we do?  There’s an organisation called [name of organisation] and we did [name].  We did online dance sessions.  And we joined in with a group called [name] and we did a last Christmas singalong last year, and that was really well received.  So we did lots of different things.  And knit and natter, we had a knit and natter group, and we called it yarn and yatter so it stood out from other knit and natter groups.  We also did an online art class for people as well.  We just tried everything, just tried as many things as possible to get people onboard.
Int:	It sounds like a great range.  And so you said then some of the uptake was a bit of a struggle.  So what were the numbers like compared to what you would have had in the more face to face times?
R:	A lot lower I think.  I wasn’t with the group when they were doing face to face, but I think their events would be fully subscribed.  They would have a lunch and it would be full.  So we had maybe a maximum of 12 people maybe for one of our sessions and a regular group of about five or six.
Int:	And so with the regular people that came along to more things and came quite often, what do you think was the motivation behind that, to keep engaging for those people?
R:	They were lonely.  They were housebound some of them.  Not all of them but a couple of them were pretty much housebound.  One of them had underlying health issues so she couldn’t get out very much.  Both of them actually couldn’t get out very much.  So it was their only way of connecting.  I think it was loneliness that motivated people to keep connected.  They just really found that benefit of seeing people and talking to people.  It was that regular interaction and knowing that people were going to be there.  It was as close to normal as it could be really.
Int:	It just goes to show that it was obviously really beneficial for those people to be able to access that.  And so obviously there was a struggle with getting people to join in the first place if they didn’t have the hardware and things.  But people that perhaps did come but then maybe dropped out or dropped off, what do you think was going on behind that?  Was there any reasons that you were aware of why people might start engaging and then think “oh actually that’s not for me”?
R:	I think it was quite popular during the winter months when we were all locked down and we couldn’t do anything else.  And then when we started to be able to be more relaxed and released people stopped coming because they wanted to get out and they wanted to see people.  So that tailed things off.  It’s like herding cats in a way as well, Zoom etiquette.  Sometimes some people would talk a lot and dominate a conversation, and some people would get left out a little bit.  It’s just taking that skill level to actually integrate everybody and keep everybody connected.  It’s easy to feel disconnected online isn’t it, more than in person?  Because you can smile at someone if you’re in a room together, that body language.  It’s easier to connect, there’s different ways to communicate in person than there is online.
	But if you’re in an online session and you feel that you’re being overlooked or ignored it’s quite difficult to reassure someone and cut across that conversation.  So I think that was maybe an issue.  I think maybe our lone man felt a bit maybe left out a little bit because he was the only man.  And I think people were scared.  With things like the art class “oh I’m not an artist”.  “You’re not supposed to be an artist, it’s not meant to be for people who are accomplished artists”.  So it’s that confidence I think.  It’s people’s self-confidence and I think maybe the pandemic has actually affected people’s self-confidence a lot more as well.  So you’ve got that on top of normal levels of lack of confidence.  
Int:	That’s a really interesting point isn’t it?  Because the remote situations are quite an intense way and there’s a lot lost in the communication isn’t there?  So despite your best efforts it’s not always going to replicate that for people.  So were you aware of if service users encountered any technical problems or any technical difficulties, were you able to give support?  What happened with that?
R:	Yeah, and that was a learning curve for us as well.  Using technology yourself is one thing, and being able to access a Zoom meeting yourself is one thing.  Then trying to support somebody and talk someone through who has got very little digital skill is quite difficult.  Trying to explain “look to the bottom left hand side of your screen, it’s the thing that looks like an ice cream”.  Just trying to put it into layman’s terms.  It really makes you think, and it’s a different skill to be able to show somebody else what to do to be able to do it yourself.  And I think the other thing that none of us realised was that we’re all using different platforms.  Not platforms but we’re always using different hardware.  So Zoom on a laptop looks different to Zoom on an iPad, looks different to Zoom on a phone.  You don’t see the same things, and you’re trying to explain to somebody “go to this or go to that” but it’s not actually there because they’re on something else.
	And whether the operating system is a Mac or Windows is very different as well.  So there were a lot of challenges.  But we were able to support, and even things like joining Zoom.  People were getting confused at first.  “What do I need to type in, do I need to pass code in?”  We didn’t do it with pass codes just to make it as simple as possible.  We had to have people register to join up to join an event which gave us that security level, but we didn’t have any pass codes or anything just to make it easy for people.
Int:	To remove an extra layer of complication isn’t it?
R:	Yeah, on the phone trying to talk people through, and just making sure that you’ve got the staff resources.  So whilst you’re trying to support somebody to join a group, to get online, the rest of the group isn’t falling apart because you’re not there.  So you’ve got to have at least two members of staff; one to keep the group going and one to support the group.  It’s a lot more coordination than you’d think.  You can’t just throw a group and expect it to happen.  There’s a lot of thinking behind that.  But we did manage to support people to join online, we got people through.
Int:	And I guess it’s that thing with thinking back as well when things have been put in place so quickly there was bound to be teething problems and trial and error at the beginning because there wasn’t that preparation before.  There just hadn’t been the time had there?
R:	And people get put off easily if something doesn’t work.  Not everybody has got that tenacity to stick with things.  “Oh it’s not worked, that’s it, I’m not doing it”.  It’s like pulling teeth almost.  I think there was a lot of that and people saying “oh it’s not working”.  Just trying to encourage people to stick with it.
Int:	So I know you’ve said there was a struggle initially with them accessing new hardware, was there anything you found around internet access and whether people already had that in place, or whether that was a challenge for some people in terms of whether maybe it was affordable or something that they could have in their house?
R:	I think there was probably issues for some people.  But obviously the people we worked with did have access and did have their own Wi-Fi already.  But I’m pretty confident that there’s a lot of people who didn’t have Wi-Fi, who didn’t have broadband, who didn’t have any access, who could have benefited but didn’t.  Our county is one of the most rural counties and one of the biggest counties with probably the worst broadband coverage in Wales.  And I think that’s a thing that needs to be addressed with people.  So I’m pretty sure there’s a whole cohort of people that we missed that we could have supported.
Int:	And so as time went on then was there anything else that you could have done to put in place in terms of that hardware, or did it not come through in terms of the funding?
R:	No.
Int:	It’s so difficult isn’t it, and I think there was obviously such competition as well at the same time for different funding and different resources.
R:	There just wasn’t.  It’s come through now.  The library now has 100 iPads all with software installed already, all with digital access from the lead librarian.  All can be taken out on a user’s library card and loaned.  So it’s all there now, it’s in place now so there’s that option now that we can do it.  So that’s really good.  But it was meant to be in place by Easter this year, and it would have made such a big difference.  We were working closely with the library, we trained up some of their staff to be able to become companions.  Obviously people couldn’t go into libraries because of lockdown, and actually even when lockdown was eased there’s still a lot of people, especially older people who were still quite nervous.  So they wouldn’t have gone to the library because they thought it’s not safe.  That’s been so deeply embedded in people’s consciousness that things aren’t safe.
Int:	And the restrictions is one thing, but then how people actually want to be is another thing.  You can’t just rely on the rules.  So I suppose on that you were obviously completely face to face before and then had to go completely virtual.  But how do you see things, I guess the last part of this year has probably been a bit of a different time and now things feel like they’re changing again.  How do you see things going forward?
R:	I’m not with the service anymore.  I’m still part of the organisation but not part of that particular project.  It’s continuing, the digital project is continuing, and I think there’ll be a blend of in-person stuff and online.  I think it’ll be a mix of the two.  I think to try and do hybrid events would be too difficult and I think we’d miss people.  I think you wouldn’t be able to give people the right amount of attention if you went to hybrid.  You’d be concentrating on people in person but then you’d miss people on the camera, or you’d be concentrating on the camera and you’d miss people in person.  So I think whilst we can there’ll probably be a mix of online groups and in-person groups.  But obviously if we go into lockdown again after Christmas it’ll be online again.
Int:	It’s a bit of a confusing time isn’t it, not knowing how things are going to look.  It sounds like you had some bits of feedback along the way from people and you were obviously aware of how things were going and things could be tweaked.  But what were some of the positive effects that people found and some of the success stories that you came across?
R:	I think one lady said “thank you for these sessions, they’ve been a lifeline to us”.  If that’s provided a lifeline then that success for me means everything.  I think people made friends online that they hadn’t done before.  They met new people and struck up their own connections and set up their own Zoom calls and chatted.  Some of the new befrienders that we paired with people formed a really strong bond and good connection, and that went well as well and actually made a difference to people.  There was a lot of fun and laughter with the [name], the online dance sessions, which were surprisingly good fun.  They were really good fun and people really enjoyed them.  We had themed sessions so that was good.  
	I think it just opened people’s horizons a little bit as well because we had people who weren’t necessarily close geographically who met, who wouldn’t have otherwise done so.  So that was good.  I think they were all positives.
Int:	And that’s interesting then, so within that people went off and made their own groups and their own friendships as well, which is really lovely.
R:	Yeah, and I think they actually developed skills as well.  They developed the skills and confidence which was good, and some of them even got smart speakers.  Some of them even took the plunge and went for smart speakers.  We had a session where one of our staff members had their smart speaker and everyone was just transfixed by it.  And one lady went off and got one, so once they got that taste for it it actually proved to be a really successful thing.  Something that was really popular.  So it’s just a shame we couldn’t reach more people but I’m hoping that the project will develop and it will reach more people.  That more people will come onboard.  Because even though it’s not a replacement for face to face, and it should never be a replacement for face to face, it is something that complements face to face and provides us an alternative when we can’t do that.
Int:	And it provides an alternative I suppose like you were saying for people when it’s a rural area or different reasons that maybe that particular week it might suit them better or something isn’t it?  
R:	Yeah, because of our locality as well and because of the people that we work with, it would be something really beneficial for a lot of the people that we work with going forward regardless of pandemic.  Because some people are housebound, some people can’t get out to groups.  This is a good way of connecting people and working together.  
Int:	Definitely, and so in terms of obviously again you’ve got the examples there of things that have gone well, but was there any formal evaluation of how using technology had gone across the service?
R:	No, we had a lot of disruption with the service so we didn’t actually do any formal review.  And it’s only been going for a year so we’ll only actually be at that review process now anyway.  I don’t think it’s been carried out yet.
Int:	And are there plans to do that do you think in a more formal way, or is it just mainly picking up on the feedback here and there from people?
R:	I think there will be, I think it will be part of our structure to do that, our reporting and monitoring structure.  
Int:	And so you said about the blend going forward, hopefully there’ll be both options.  What we spoke about before, this fear around using technology and some people being fearful of internet fraud and scams.  And we know that that’s an issue particularly for older people.  And so is that something that you felt able to persuade people around or encourage them around, or was that not within your remit to do that?
R:	No we did.  I think because some of the people that were working with us as befrienders had those concerns as well.  So we even did a bespoke session with [digitally focused organisation] on online safety.  So we trained people on that, we had people attend.  So we did address that.
Int:	And did that work for people?  I suppose it got the people staying engaged, or some people couldn’t be persuaded?
R:	No, I think it worked really well.  [name of digitally focused organisation], I can’t praise them highly enough.  They’ve been absolutely brilliant.  We worked really closely with them.  So it worked well, and there’s a lot of resources on their site that people can access.  There’s a code that we’ve got now because we’ve done the training, there’s a whole of data and resources that our befrienders can access and work through with people.  So I think that’s something that can be built on.
Int:	And so just when we were talking about the positive impacts that people had, and there was obviously various.  The flip side to that, were there any unexpected negative consequences or effects that people had from using the technology do you think?
R:	I think some people who had difficulties maybe went away, maybe that affected their confidence and self-esteem who didn’t come back.  Maybe that is one of the downsides of it.  But then because people go away you can’t actually work out why someone’s not attended.  And I think maybe not being able to join as well would have upset some people if they’d struggled and couldn’t get on.  Even if we’d tried to support them maybe put off.  It’s like being offered a carrot isn’t it, you’ve had this dangled and you can join and then you can’t.  So that is almost more disappointing than not having anything anyway.  That promise of something that’s then taken away.
Int:	And it’s like you were saying about that frustration of when something doesn’t work, and it is sometimes tempting to just think “oh right, well leave it then”.  And then that creates a frustration that you don’t want to go back and change it, which is hard in those times when no one could come around and help, it’s really difficult.  Well that’s pretty much all my questions.  Thank you so much for all that information, that’s so helpful.  Was there anything else you wanted to share or any examples or any stories or anything?
R:	No, I think it’s just good to be able to share.  The more that we can work on it and raise awareness and support people, it’s going to be beneficial isn’t it?  
Int:	Yeah definitely, and it’s really interesting talking to people from different areas across Wales as well, and how the different locations have experienced things particularly around the pandemic for sure [section removed for confidentiality reason]
R:	That’s great, thank you, and good luck with your research, I hope it goes well.
Int:	Thanks very much.
R:	Take care, bye-bye, have a good Christmas.
Int:	And you, bye.

Recording Details:		P006 











Int:	So you will have done the survey because that’s how we’ve got through.
R:	Yeah, and then the additional information and comments.
Int:	Yeah, so then we asked for a case study, and I think I’ve got on here that you said you would provide one.  So it might have been that we’d asked for an example or a story of a case study that’s happened in your organisation.  So it might be that but we can come back to that at the end, so no worries.  Just for the purposes of this then, so to start with can you give me just a brief overview of your role and the organisation that you work for?
R:	So I’m a [job title].  I currently work within an older people’s team in the community for the local authority, for [name of council].  So my day to day work is pretty much as it is for older people’s services across the board these days.  It’s just basically care management.  I know that sounds a bit “oh just” but it’s assessment, care and support planning and reviewing care that we set up.  I do carry out mental capacity and best interest assessments.  And it’s multidisciplinary working so working alongside health colleagues as well.  
Int:	And so within that then, it must be a very busy hectic role, how much focus is there on preventing loneliness and social isolation for your clients?
R:	Well that’s a key part of the Care Act isn’t it around wellbeing.  So it’s about setting up services.  It’s about using the third sector.  So just as an example because of my sensory background I strongly champion that a lot, and that comes into play with a lot of things I do.  So for example if somebody is struggling to get out because of their sensory loss, and then not least because of their physical frailty as well often with some of the older people I’m working with, then it’s about looking at ways to bridge that gap really.  So it might be that telephone ring round service that [name of organisation] offer.  And it’s about looking at day services as well, but our day services with COVID obviously look very different.  So it is a part of the considerations that we make during the assessment really, is about their social isolation, looking at social inclusion for them. 
Int:	And so you mentioned then within that about the sensory loss side of things, and so that being a particular group that you do focus on.  So are there any other groups that are most affected by loneliness or isolation do you think?
R:	I should just say generally I think a lot of the older people that we work with, some of them now don’t have any friends, they’ve outlived their friends.  Families are living quite separately these days as well, so the support from families isn’t always there as it was years ago.  So some people are just living on their own, they might not know who their neighbours are.  And that’s quite a common feature really with a lot of older people.  But I focus on sensory a lot as well because obviously if somebody has got a sensory loss either hearing or visual, or both, that isolates them even further.
Int:	Yes definitely, that makes sense.  So it’s a key focus.  So from what you’re saying then just even generally across the older adults that you work with it is a problem or it can be an issue.
R:	Yeah, and obviously COVID has come along and compounded that hasn’t it?  
Int:	Yeah, and so it’s interesting because it’s thinking about COVID then and thinking back the early days when it was that first lockdown set of restrictions.  What sort of conversations were happening in your organisation, [name of organisation] teams about how technology might need to be used with people going forward?
R:	Well in terms of our interaction with service users in order to protect them as well during COVID we were looking at more creative ways.  So we might be considering using Zoom, Teams.  Not everyone has a computer at home and that is the problem.  So it was about if somebody had a mobile phone using WhatsApp, doing video calls.  Just finding different ways of being able to connect with people and to reach out to them.  And that is the same across the work we were doing when we were reviewing people in care homes.  We were having to do quite a lot of it on the phone, doing video calls.  And I absolutely get that not all people have got a mobile phone, and not all people have got a computer.  Not all people are interested in social media, Facebook and all those sorts of things.
	So connecting with people is still quite difficult.  And some people choose not to have those things.  There’s a lot of older people that still won’t have a mobile phone.  So there’s a lot of work I think that still needs to be done.  I think as this generation is coming forward, as they’re getting older they’ll have experienced technology in quite a different way.  But I still think we’re working with a group of people now of their generation who didn’t have mobile phones.  The thought of doing a video call with somebody was alien to them.  So I think going forward as we’re aging we’ll have that experience.  That will be the norm for us.  Mobile phones, video calling, computers, anything like that.  And it will be much easier I guess.  So we try to do stuff but it’s difficult.  You can’t say to somebody “oh I think you should get a computer and then you’ll be able to do this, this and this”.  
	Because a lot of people as well that we work with, by the time they come to us there are quite complex issues.  People are coming into social care now because of all the eligibility criteria, with the Care Act it’s about looking at people’s eligibility as well.  But sometimes by the time people come to us they’ve got quite complex needs.  So going into those conversations around “oh have you got a computer or have you got a mobile phone?”  Sometimes when we talk with them or with families, it might be the family have got them a mobile phone.   I’ve been in [name of city] the last 18 months and there’s only one person I’ve worked with that has a tablet, and on that tablet the family had set up a very simple thing where they could connect with the family by video call for a weekly catch-up.  But actually this lady I worked with had had a career as an administrator and her mind worked in that way that she was able to cope with that.  Whereas quite a lot of people aren’t in my experience.
Int:	It’s interesting, so from what you’re saying there’s a few different aspects to it.  So there’s the age side to it perhaps where the older-older adults have had less exposure to technology maybe, so that’s a little bit more tricky.  And then perhaps the younger or depending on what someone’s done in their life previously they might be a more confident do you think with the technology?
R:	Yeah, a bit more confident.  Part of what their role was in their job meant that they were used to interfacing with people in different ways so it wouldn’t be so alien to them.
Int:	So it sounds like you had to cover a lot of different bases thinking about how to access people and be able to do the work that you normally do in that pandemic situation.  So focusing on loneliness and isolation within that then, what were the particular things you would try to engage people with in terms of technology, what went well I suppose?
R:	It was just with telephone calls.  Just having that conversation, touching base with people.  And putting third sector in touch with them so that they were part of a ring around service for example, so that they felt that somebody was checking in with them if they had no family that could do that.  Just having that contact.  
Int:	And so you mentioned before as well about the various different options you had.  So you had the WhatsApp smartphone or using the landline phone.  So can you just tell me a bit more about some of the things that you did to maintain that contact or to help the people to go away and maintain the contact with others perhaps in terms of loneliness?  So what were the different types of things that you were using?
R:	So we would encourage people, we would say “if you have a mobile phone, is there any way that family can support you to set something up?”  Like a tablet for instance.  Basically for me not all older people are going to embrace technology, and that’s a given.  And also if somebody has a sensory loss again technology has to be set up in a specific way.  Over the last 18 months since I’ve been working with this local authority my experience has been that we’ve had to make do and mend basically.  So we’ve been doing telephone calls to clients.  We’ve had to do reviews over the telephone for the best part of it, particularly with care homes.  And as part of that I was encouraging speaking to somebody say on WhatsApp video.  So it would have to be connected with somebody that had that facility on their phone in the home and we could do that.  
	So a lot of stuff we were having to do quite remotely rather than face to face.  Encouraging older people to look at technology that would help them to reduce social isolation.  If they couldn’t use a mobile phone it was going to be limited really to what we could encourage, and somebody that’s starting with memory loss.  A lot of people we work with have got a certain degree of memory loss or they’re more complex advanced dementia and it’s much more difficult.  
Int:	So that option’s not there.
R:	Sorry, I’ve not really answered your question.
Int:	No, that’s really helpful and it’s interesting just to pick on a couple of those bits.  So you said about the family support, if it’s already in place, if people have got family involved and you can almost use that as a way in to say “can they help you to set something up?”  So that might be something that helps the situation along.  But what about when people don’t have that family support, or you’re aware that there’s nobody nearby who could have come in to help them, was that a particular barrier?  How did you go around those?
R:	Yeah, that’s always going to be a barrier isn’t it I guess, because whilst we like to think there’s that big society out there, there isn’t.  And whilst we like to think that there’s a lot of voluntary third sector available, there isn’t.  Yes it exists, but they don’t have the staffing levels because not everyone wants to volunteer these days.  And so a lot of third sector organisations have to operate within constraints.  They’re limited to what they can provide.  But if somebody doesn’t have family we can refer them to supporting people organisations, third sector organisations like for example [name of organisation], Age Cymru.  So there are organisations out there.  We’ve had community connectors within the council that we can then ask to make contact with people as well.  So we are very much relying on trying to refer over, signpost over to these different organisations.  
Int:	So drawing on those other options that hopefully might be able to help.
R:	Yeah, but again because of the constraints with COVID, but even prior to COVID in all honesty these voluntary organisations just don’t have the levels of staffing or volunteers that would really make a huge difference.  People are still waiting on a waiting list, or they can have this but it’s time limited.  And you just think “well if you can only have four to six weeks of this, the loneliness and whatever it is they need doesn’t stop after that”.  “What happens then?”
Int:	And it sounds like that that’s quite frustrating from your side to know that that need is there but not perhaps know, they may be isolated, they may be lonely but you’re limited in what you can offer aren’t you?
R:	And also there are people that don’t want any input.  It’s a piece of work in itself trying to get someone to the point where they might feel confident about participating in something which would reduce their social isolation.  
Int:	Well I was just going to ask you about that.
R:	And that can be a barrier in itself.  Sometimes if somebody has been on their long for so long and they’re like “oh I’m not interested”.  But there’s a lot of things that become apparent that perhaps that social isolation, that loneliness is impacting on their health and wellbeing.  And there’s a piece of work there that needs to be done in order to support that person to a point where they may feel that “actually do you know what, I do want to connect with people”.  
Int:	It’s really interesting you mentioned that because I was going to say about the sense of knowing that there’s people that just don’t want it.  We know with older adults particularly thinking about technology there’s a sense of fear sometimes around using it, and maybe not wanting to break the device or being afraid of internet scams and fraud and things like that.  So is that something that you came across when you were engaging with people via these different methods that you wouldn’t have had to before that there was that sense of the reasons behind why people didn’t want to use things?
R:	Yeah, I can recall comments around things like “oh I couldn’t possibly do that because you hear about all these things that can happen”.  And in all honesty I share that same fear.  I’m [over 50] years old but I share that fear.  It took me ages, it took me up until last year to get a banking app on my phone.  So it’s not necessarily just about older age, but yes with older age obviously it comes with the additional fear.  It’s the fear of the unknown because they don’t have that familiarity with IT that the younger generation have these days.  I had one.  It wasn’t the cared for, it was the carer that had an iPad they were using and then they got scammed.  They also used it to keep in touch with the family as well, and then they panicked and they literally broke the iPad.  They physically destroyed the iPad because they were scared.  
	They were questioning whether they should go ahead and get another one.  As it happened the daughter talked them into it and they did, but people are wary of technology.  Because all we hear about these days is scamming and cyber-attacks and this and that.  And for an older person that just doesn’t have that familiarity necessarily with technology it’s going to be doubly hard for them to trust it isn’t it?
Int:	Yeah, and like you say it is understandable, but it’s also about trying to unpick that I suppose and try and help in a way that’s supportive.  But it is difficult and like you say it’s that fear of the unknown for a lot of people.  And I suppose is there anything you have, it’s an interesting example you gave but I suppose the flip side to that where the change in circumstances and doing things remotely and encouraging the technology where there was some real positive examples of how that went for people?
R:	I can’t remember sorry.  If I put anything in my feedback before it may have been because I was sat and I was able to just think about that on that day, and then type that response.  But I’ve got things going off on my cases and I’m doing a hospital discharge at the moment so my brain doesn’t really flip about into different things sorry.
Int:	No, don’t worry at all.  
R:	I’m just trying to think.
Int:	Just even if there’s that sense of some of the positive effects or the benefits from using technology.
R:	So not about computers but this is technology.  So going back to the sensory bit I often work with people, because of my background I often get some of the cases that come through that have got a hearing or visual loss element.  So I’ve encouraged my team that I work with, my colleagues, to use a digital hearing communicator for example.  Because a lot of people that are very hard of hearing that perhaps won’t wear hearing aids for whatever reason, they cannot participate in assessments, conversations, medical reviews, anything that requires them to be able to hear information.  To receive it and to be able to make sense of it and respond.  And often other people get “oh they’re confused”.  And actually it’s not they’re confused, it’s that they can’t hear what you’re asking or talking to them about.
	So one of the things that I champion the use of because of my experience is digital hearing communicators.  And it’s a simple thing, it’s a little box with a microphone and a volume button and headphones that the person wears you’re speaking to.  It amplifies your voice, and it just enables people to be able to hear.  My one case that I worked with, in fact it was the same one where the wife destroyed the iPad.  But he was quite hard of hearing, he couldn’t wear hearing aids because he had this issue with one of his ears and was constantly infected and whatever.  So anyway the family were frustrated with him.  The wife was like “he’s not interested, it’s like he’s shut down, he’s in his own world”.  So I took along one of the communicators and I explained what I was going to do.  He put the headphones on, I put the volume on quite high unfortunately but that was the level he could hear at, and he was responding to questions.
	And as I was asking them the wife was sat there with her mouth open going “I don’t believe this”.  She said “I’ve never heard him talk so much”.  I shared this with the team because I was just so gob smacked, but for the first time he was able to hear his three year old or four year old grandson speak.  Because all he could hear was just some very low level background noise, but not speech at all.  But he was able to hear his little grandson speak.  And do you know what, he brightened up, he was much more responsive.  His wife was like “I’m going to get one of those, I need to get one of those”.  So that’s what she did, she got one so that they could use it as a family and it made a huge difference.  Well that’s communication, that’s reducing his social isolation because he could sit in the same room as another human being, but if you can’t hear them talk.
Int:	Absolutely, it’s another level to it isn’t it?  It’s not just the loneliness as in not having people around, but it’s being isolated from the people who you are around and that is another dimension.
R:	Yeah, and he became less anxious.  In his wife’s words “he’s not as grumpy”.  Because she would say something, and because he couldn’t hear her he would be just like “oh”.  So that’s using technology for communication, and that’s my experience and that’s a really good example.
Int:	Yeah, that’s a great example definitely, and it is coming at it on that deeper level as well.  It’s not just people that have not got anyone around, but that particular need within that.  And so thinking then just about, and I don’t know if you mentioned this before but being aware of the different devices or the different setups that people already have.  You were saying you’re aware not everyone has a computer or a smartphone or whatever.  With the people that you work with, have you been aware of internet access and that access to the technology in itself, whether that might be financial issues or those kinds of things.  Has that been a challenge at all?
R:	So whether that’s been a barrier to somebody, so financial issues being a barrier to them being able to purchase.  No, I wouldn’t say so.  I’d say it was less likely to be financial and more likely to be that they’re just not interested.  Certainly I’ve not had anything come to light where I’ve been told that somebody can’t afford maybe to have a smartphone or a computer.  I’ve not been aware of that at all.  
Int:	That’s interesting, so the main thing was more that people just didn’t want to engage and just didn’t want to be onboard with the technology.
R:	Yeah, being fearful of it really.
Int:	And that’s like you were saying before.  And I suppose when you encountered those conversations then when there was limited scope to encourage people I guess and they were quite set, what kind of things can you say in your role or can you do to move forward when you were so limited with other options about how to help people?
R:	Well the thing is you can only give people information and advice and signposting.  Obviously if somebody has dementia and perhaps they lack capacity to understand and even consent perhaps to have some form of technology which would link them to other people and reduce their social isolation for example.  At the end of the day you can only give people information and advice about things.  I’m quite an assertive [job title] I would say in that I don’t just leave things there.  If I feel something could do with a little bit of gently pushing things along I’m not backwards in coming forward.  I will say “come on”.  I was moving furniture with an OT last week, so it was like “come on, we’ve got to do this”.  “Come on, let’s get the neighbour”.  The neighbour’s a friend, come round.  Yeah, we’ll get this done.  And we did it within half an hour, and the wife’s like “oh okay”.  And I’m like “it’s done now”.  
	If I hadn’t have been that assertive [job title] that OT would have gone back week after week after week, the furniture would not have been moved to make room for the hoist.  It wouldn’t have happened.  But I’m quite “come on, let’s get this sorted”.  A bit gung-ho at times but not to the extent where I’m stepping on someone’s rights or whatever.  So for me it’s information and advice, encouragement, and if somebody’s not going to grasp it.  If somebody’s just not interested, then the best I can hope is that maybe if I set a day service up for them or the ring around service.  They’re getting some form of contact if they are completely without family or friends or whatever and they’re very isolated.  
Int:	So you’ve got those options.  Like you say that’s the most you can do, it’s not a sense of wanting to force people is it, it is a difficult thing to overcome.
R:	And we’ve got [name of project], we’ve got the [name of project] and they can go and take people out.  I’ve referred people to them.  That is a funded service but it nevertheless is there.  We’ve got a visual impairment club which now is closed until March because of COVID again.  But that’s something that is there for people who are elderly and have a sensory loss.  So there are things there, although there are not many.  
Int:	It’s a tricky one isn’t it?  You mentioned then about things changing again with COVID and I know we covered this in the survey but just thinking.  How do you anticipate things going forward?  I guess you perhaps went from being fully face to face before really to then having to use those more creative forms of technology with your clients.  But how do you see things going forward?  I appreciate it’s a bit of a strange time right now.
R:	Well we did return to being able to do face to face visits, and we were just about starting to return to going into care homes but now things are starting to draw back again.  We are still able to do face to face visits at the moment when we’re doing our lateral flow tests and whatever.  And I think going forward post COVID, or the best we can get to post COVID, I think actually we will be doing face to face visits with people.  At the beginning we all found it really uncomfortable sitting and talking to somebody on the phone, having to do as much as we could over the telephone.  We all found that difficult.  We’re used to going out and sitting with people in their homes, you see much more about what’s going on in their environment.  It was a struggle.  
	However we adapted and I don’t see us going back to just doing completely on the telephone or just using that as a reason.  I still think it’s always going to be important for us to go out and do a face to face with a client basically.
Int:	That makes sense, and some things just needs that contact doesn’t it, that visual.  Is there anything with the remote side of things that if it was to stay part of your work, that could make that improved for being in touch with people that would make that system run better if you were using technology?
R:	Well I guess the technology is only going to be workable if the person at the other end that were reaching out to has got that technology.  So I don’t know.  Is there a place for a bit more media coverage, a bit more information being made available to older people to encourage them to consider technology?  I have an awareness of not just the sensory stuff but also alongside that is the assistive technology that we have an abundance of now.  There’s so much technology available for people.  But just the word itself “technology” frightens people doesn’t it?  So I think there’s probably a need for there to be more media coverage around connectivity, technology, so it encourages perhaps older people and their families maybe to consider it a bit more rather than dismissing it as like “oh no, we can’t do that”.  
	And a [job title] going “well you know what, if you had this and this”.  “No, mum won’t have that because she’ll just worry and then we’ll end up having to do this, and then she’ll lose it all”.  And then she’ll go “oh then this will get scammed”.  And actually I think it has to come from somewhere a little bit wider than that, the messages.  They have to be given a bit more wider, and I don’t know whether the government can do that or organisations like Age UK or Age Cymru or whatever that could do a campaign to encourage older people to actually embrace technology a bit more.  The message is about being lonely.  How we can help you?  If you have this then it might mean you’re not so lonely.  It’s that sort of thing.
Int:	That’s a really interesting point.  And so from what you’re saying it would be helpful if that message from coming from a broader sense and it was being built up anyway in other things.  So that when people like you were doing their work it wasn’t a reactive solution I guess to be “oh let’s do this, or let’s suggest this” and catch people off the hook.  I suppose it’s having that awareness and building that up, and it’s not so easy to do it in a quick situation over the phone.  It maybe needs a bit more.  And so there’s obviously some of the specific examples that you’ve got, but are you aware in your organisation more broadly of any evaluation that’s been done about how people have found using technology for loneliness or isolation?
R:	I’ll be really honest, since I’ve been with the authority I’m with now I don’t recall anything coming up around this.  But I’m afraid these days I work on a need to know basis.  When I need to know something.  So much information gets flooded through day after day by email, by technology, and you have to be quite discerning and think “right, I’ll park that for now because when I do come across somebody I’ll know that I need this and then I can look and see what I’ve got in my info box”.  So I couldn’t honestly say that there’s been anything that’s evaluated the importance of technology in combatting loneliness.  
Int:	That’s fine, it’s completely understandable.  I suppose it’s just about whether going forward, and it sounds like on a personal basis with the clients that you work with you would know how it had gone for them, and you would get that day to day feedback for how they were using things.  But whether there is anything that would be beneficial to get more evaluation from people in order to improve things going forward.  
R:	Yeah, with the day services at the moment, they’re re-evaluating those.  Because with them having closed the day centres through COVID, and then they were doing some community support remotely from a fixed base, they’ve been evaluating how that was going this year in terms of whether it goes back to a full day at a day centre scenario or a mix and match with community support.  So in that sense in terms of social inclusion I think they are looking at that.  But in terms of technology and loneliness I couldn’t honestly say.  I do see that there’s a value for that I guess, but again we could signpost people to [name of four organisations] because they have a sensory area which they’ve got funding through for bits of equipment and so on.
	So it’s where does that equipment come from?  Whilst we’re selling the fact that technology could be really helpful in reducing loneliness, are we selling that as a message that “and then you go off”?  Or are we selling it as a message that if you can’t afford it, where is that technology then going to come from?  And that would be a barrier wouldn’t it, to any local authority because they’re struggling to keep care going and stuff like that.  So to put themselves in a position of sending a message that technology will reduce your loneliness, and that person can’t afford it, who’s going to purchase that piece of equipment?  Whether it’s a phone or a computer or a tablet.  So that would be a bit of a barrier in itself wouldn’t it I guess?
Int:	Yeah, it’s interesting isn’t it?  So it’s all well and good saying that you want to encourage it, but you have to be aware I suppose of what barriers there are people on the other end and how realistic it is for them.  
R:	Exactly, in terms of purchasing and setting things up if there’s no family.  It’s like “okay, well have a computer”.  That would need setting up and that would need somebody from some organisation that would have to do that.  So I don’t think information technology is really, apart from what’s used within local authority, outside of that with service users I don’t think a great deal of thought has ever really been put into it to a point where it’s established that “yes, this is what we’re going to try and push, this is how we’re going to do it, and these are the people that would perhaps come and sort these things out”.
Int:	Yeah, do you think that would be useful to have a stronger process like that in place?
R:	I think it would be actually.  And across the board, it should be a UK wide thing.  First of all broadening the message across and bringing it from some higher authority to encourage older people in using technology to reduce loneliness.  And maybe through that filtering down to local authorities.  We are supposed to consider things, and I suppose from my background as well that’s already there for me.  It’s a given that when I’m doing an assessment, and if I know they’ve got a visual or a hearing impairment or sensory there might be bits of assistive technology where I think “oh yeah, that could work for them”.  And I talk to them and I try and filter that through to colleagues.  And there are people across the whole UK that have got different experiences around technology, and that may or may not sell it to their service users.
	But I think there needs to be a more global message that with our greater aging population, again it’s like the care situation.  It’s been under-funded.  Older people don’t want to think about it.
Int:	And I guess one of the things that we’re interested in is how different organisations have been able to deal with the people who we can’t reach, and the people who it’s difficult to reach through technology, and the pandemic obviously brought that into reality.  I suppose with your role there was that more essential element to it that you would have been able to reach people probably one way or another because it was so crucial.  But there is a question there.
R:	Yeah, because people refer themselves in or family or paramedics will refer them into our front door, and they’ll come to us that way.  We’re then making that contact and reaching out to them.  But unless they’re referred into the service we’re not going to know about them.  They’ll only become visible if sometimes happens within the community, they’re seen by somebody in the health sector or a neighbour or a family member.  
Int:	And it comes back to what you were saying at the beginning that then by that point sometimes things are already quite complex.  So then to throw a different technology or something else into the mix is not straightforward because you’re already dealing with perhaps a different bunch of other things.  Well thank you.  This is pretty much all of my questions.  
[section removed for confidentiality]
There’s nothing right or wrong, it’s just a case of seeing what’s been done or maybe what hasn’t been done and seeing how things have varied, and then going forward from there.  But we will then also want to speak to some of the older adults themselves as well to see what their experience has been.  But it’s been really interesting so far speaking to different people from different places.  We’re quite near the beginning so we’ve still got quite a few more bits to do.  
R:	Well that’s good.  It’s good that you’re doing that, it’s really important.  And hopefully coming out of this will be something that will work towards a global message across Wales or the UK around how can we reduce isolation using technology?  How can we encourage older people to use it, and make it easier for them?
Int:	Definitely, I think that’s a really interesting point that you made about doing it on that level.  I suppose it’s not always something that occurs to do it just overall.  It’s not always straightforward.  But once those things are there it’s that messaging isn’t it?
R:	Yeah, interestingly I think banks have tried over the years to try and encourage people.  They’ve called it [name] haven’t they and stuff like that.  So I know the banking sector have probably tried to do that.  Mind you there’s a bit of self-interest because they were closing branches and probably wanted to make sure that older people could still access their bank account.
Int:	Yeah, but it’s a similar thing with the contact isn’t it, and just having that familiarity I suppose.
R:	Yeah, but as long as it’s been of some help anyway.
Int:	Absolutely, it’s really helpful, thank you so much.  So that’s fine, and thank you for giving such detailed examples, it’s really useful.  So we may be in touch perhaps in the New Year but no pressure.  We’ll keep you on the radar and any help you can give is great.  But thank you so much for taking the time today.  Well take care and have a lovely Christmas.
R:	And you, bye-bye now.
Int:	Thank you, bye.

Int:	So to start with then if you could just give me a brief overview of your role and the organisation that you work for.
R:	So I work for [name of organisation].  Just before lockdown we’d started to take over the telecare and assistive technology to start a project of trying to get people involved more in technology within our service, to expand it and work with it.  So I was on secondment for a year before lockdown to start using the technology, to get it out there, to roll it out.  But unfortunately for us we didn’t get it in time as much as we’d have liked to have got it started.  Because it would have been absolutely amazing during COVID to have actually got so much more people using it before.  But we’ve picked up the pace again now with our assistive technology.  We’re using Alexas which we’ve had from the [name of funder] to roll out within [name of city]. So we’ve got quite a few out there.  
	The success that we’ve had from them has been amazing.  And the response we’ve had from people, more the older people say in their 80s and 90s I’ve worked with a lot.  They’ve embraced it so much.  I set one up yesterday actually for a 92 year old who has found the whole process amazing to be able to access things just by talking to it.  It’s just been amazing for her.  Lots of my older people like them.  But we’ve also been involved in a trial called Komp, which is no isolation, which is a [nationality] unit.  We’re trialling for them at the moment and the response from that has been amazing as well.  So that’s a couple of the projects that [name of city] are undergoing at the minute to combat the isolation in our elderly.
Int:	That’s loads of information to start with.
R:	Well it’s something I feel quite passionate about as well, and I’m trying to use the technology to expand that, not just to use that for communicating but also in an occupational therapy way.  Trying to get people to use it to be more independent.  So we’d be using it for lighting, for plugs so they don’t have to bend.  So window openers, curtain openers.  So we’ve expanded it quite a lot to give people that independence as well, being mindful as well we’re not preventing them from seeing people.  So we’re trying not to make them so that they’re staying inside the house, but it’s also to give them that independence and that confidence to do things themselves because that has a knock-on effect, sociable as well.
Int:	And so your role specifically then, are you involved in the going out and setting it up in people’s homes, or are you more managing the team behind that, what does your role specifically look like?
R:	It’s me.  So we identify the people when we go out and see them as well.  So I advise some of the other team as well if they need any support in setting them up.  So I’ve been assisting some of our team members to get them set up in the home so that they can do them themselves as well.  So I’m advising them, doing a lot of the research around what we can do with them.  Just before the meeting with yourself now I had a meeting with my manager to see what other things we can connect to Alexa, what other things we could use to make people more independent so they’re not so isolated.  Because we’re having a problem with care at the moment as well, so having that care, using the Alexa, family can just drop in, talk to them and see that they’re okay just as the welfare calls really.  Whereas the family couldn’t normally do that.  So I’m the support for our team to set that up.  I also do a lot of the initial setups as well.  
Int:	So you mentioned there the loneliness and reducing that sense of isolation and increasing independence was there, and that’s a priority it seems like.  When you said that you started this technology roll out before COVID, so was the focus of that then thinking of your occupational therapy side?  Was it more about the physical side of things or was it focused on the loneliness?
R:	It was a bit of both actually.  Because we know that a lot of people suffer with loneliness, and it was something that we’ve identified for many years where we haven’t had that much technology.  So the idea was that they could communicate with other people, they could have groups they can set up with using the Alexa as well.  Because as long as somebody else has got that Alexa, if they’ve got a friend that they want to communicate with that’s something that we could look at as well.  If they haven’t got it we can set them up with it as well just so that they’ve got that constant communication with someone.  I’d gone around to [inaudible 5:12].  They’ve got that system as well where they have two Alexas set up with a friend and the person that’s blind can’t see anybody but they can talk to each other.  She’s close up to the screen of the Echo Show, she can actually see the outlines so she knows there’s someone there, which made her feel better just knowing that that person could see her.
	So it wasn’t just so much that she could see them, or she couldn’t see them, they could see her and see that she was okay.  So that was the aim really because they take up a lot of resources.  I know it sounds absolutely dreadful but we have people that were phoning 999 just to talk to someone because they didn’t have anyone that they could talk to.  Because that person would come out, the responder would then come out and see them, whether it was a police officer or a paramedic, there was somebody that was going to be at the end of that call and they knew it.  So by setting them up with the Alexa they could speak to family who had that video calling technology as well.  They didn’t need to worry too much.  So it was reducing that.  That was our aim, was to try and combat that loneliness within that group of people.
Int:	You said that that’s something that would be noticeable as a change, is that something that’s been evaluated or assessed to see if it has reduced those calls maybe or those contacts?
R:	One or two of them I’ve been able to keep in contact with.  Not all the time because it’s really hard to keep people constantly ringing them, they don’t always like that.  I’ve had two particular ones.  One that has actually Completely stopped calling 999, and has realised as well the amount of times they had called 999 because they could see from the video calls how many times they’d call a member of family or a support worker via the Alexa.  And I think they’d come to realise that they needed to get out more.  So that had a positive effective on that person, but that was a younger person who needed to get out and socialise more.  The other lady didn’t want to go out, but she was extremely lonely but didn’t want to interact with people because she didn’t like the whole feeling of going out and socialising.  
	For her the Alexa has brought more for her because she’s been talking to it.  She said it was like a lifeline to her.  It’s not so much she was talking to other people, it was more that she was able to talk to something, and she found that to be more humbling more than anything.  Because she felt that she didn’t need to see or speak to a human, but she had Alexa to talk to.  She asked it questions and it answered her.  So for her it reduced her loneliness quite a lot in a different way.
Int:	So it’s almost like people perhaps think they need more of a contact, but actually just a little bit might be enough.
R:	Yeah, it was just somebody answering her, somebody that she could actually talk to.  Because her son was grown up and was going to college, she didn’t have anything.  So it was also helping her to talk and get things coming back to her that was reminding her as well with her appointments, her medication.  So we set all that up on there for her as well so that she wasn’t constantly relying on care.  So it was reducing the amount of care that she was having so that she could just do things for herself, which gave her so much more confidence.  So it was a lot of things that came out of that just by providing that Alexa for her.
Int:	That’s amazing isn’t it?  So much difference from one thing.  One of the things we’re looking at mainly is the impact of COVID and the pandemic.  So your situation sounds quite interesting because it was already underway prior.  Can you just tell me a bit about how some of those conversations about the plans of what you were going to be doing, how you were going to be doing things changed when the pandemic started right at the beginning?
R:	Well it put a stop to everything we were doing because we weren’t allowed to visit anybody because of the pandemic.  So our job then mostly had to go back to my normal job, which is [type of case worker].  So I had to go back to that role.  But we still tried to slot in a lot of the plans to help people, to see people again.  So we were trying to up it again.  So we were putting it into the elderly people who were vulnerable.  So our plan changed then to looking at different criteria of people.  So we were looking at the more elderly people who couldn’t have visitors.  And they were lonely, they were suffering because their mental health was suffering because they couldn’t see anybody.  Care was reduced at that time as well for them.  
	So if they were receiving carers that was being reduced down because they had to put the priorities elsewhere because health needs were changing with other people.  So it was all being stretched and pulled.  So we rolled out during COVID the Komp which were for people with dementia who weren’t getting that regular contact.  The dementia was getting worse for them because they weren’t seeing people.  So we trialled the Komp with a few of our elderly people.  It helped them because they were able to see family, recognising faces.  So that interaction for them was so important for them to be able to see family still, to be able to see the pictures.  Because they could send photographs in, they could call in when they needed to check in on them.  It helped the family as well, because family who were so frustrated they couldn’t go and see these vulnerable people.  They were able to ring in and they didn’t have to answer.  So with the Komp, I don’t know if you know anything about the Komp.
Int:	I have a brief look, only because actually you mentioned it in your survey and I just had a quick look because I’d not known much about it before.  So it answers it automatically after a set amount of time.
R:	Because a lot of our people that we were looking at putting these Alexas in for, they couldn’t answer, they didn’t quite understand the whole concept of it.  So the aim for the Komp was to target people that didn’t have any technology experience or knowhow.  So this was put in for them.  It just sits in the room with them, it just switches on.  They don’t have to do anything with it, just leave it on.  The person then rings in.  Professionals can ring in as well and conduct appointments through it.  So for them it was giving them a bit of freedom to be able to still have their appointments because they didn’t have to go out.  They still saw family and it was real time as well.  Could send photographs to them as well.
Int:	And when you were rolling that out, was that people who were still in their own homes or was that maybe more in care homes?
R:	That was in their own homes and that was targeting people for isolation.  That was the main purpose of the Komp was to combat the isolation for people.  Because they don’t need the wifi for this one either, so it comes with their own SIM.  So they didn’t need to have the technology there, so it was easy to roll this one out for us.  We didn’t have to do too much for it, the family did most of the work.  We just went out, showed them how to use it, and then if they couldn’t go out to see them for any reason they were able to still have that communication.  The case studies for that one for me have been amazing.  Because the feedback we’ve had, the families are happier because they can see them.  The client has been happy too.  One or two of them were a little bit cheeky, they tried to turn it off.  They’re so used to turning everything off at night when they go to bed, and they just go round switching it off because it just looks like an old radio system or the old TVs with the knobs on them.	
	But the feedback we’ve had from them.  The one lady, she feels that she can still see people, but she sees them more now.  Because her grandchildren are in university in [name of city], they ring in to her, she gets to see them.  So she feels so much happier being able to see them.  
Int:	That’s really interesting.  So that particular device has got that real drive towards the loneliness and isolation.  Whereas the Alexa has got that, but also the more independence and some more physical things that go in with that as well.  Is there quite a few people that you’ve done the combination of both with now, you’ve managed to do a bit of both?
R:	Yeah, so I’ve got gentleman.  He’s got cerebral palsy and the wife has got MS.  So the two of them, I’ve had to do both with them because we’re using the Alexa for the technology to make them independent.  So we’ve got the voice controls to do the curtains, the lighting, the plugs for the TV.  So Alexa does that for them, but what they don’t have is with the Komp you don’t have that interaction.  This has got the big screen, they can see it properly.  Because of his hands he can’t do anything, he can’t answer the phone.  So they were quite isolated during the first lockdown because they couldn’t communicate with anybody.  Both of them were extremely vulnerable, and they were quite lonely.  They just had each other for company and it gets a little bit …
Int:	Sorry about that, I think it should be all right now.  It was up until they were together in the first lockdown, this couple, and so they only had the two of them.
R:	So I started doing the Alexa a little bit into the first lockdown I started setting it up for them.  The Komp came after.  Because the trial didn’t start until midway through the second lockdown.  So we got it in pretty much towards the middle of the second lockdown and they were able to see their children.  If they can’t answer the normal phone the children were able to ring in and check on them, and they could see them, they could talk to them.  So the two they’ve been evaluating for me, because he’s very good for that.  So he’s been evaluating both of them to see which one works better.  But they’ve both got their pluses and both got their negatives on both devices.  So whereas the Komp they can’t call out on that one, they can only call in.  But they can receive the photographs of the children, so they’ve enjoyed that concept of it.
	The only thing about the Komp is the restriction on not being able to call out.  But he likes both of them.  He likes the technology with the Alexa because it gives him the freedom to be able to open up his curtains on his own.  He doesn’t have to wait for the carers to come in.  He doesn’t have to have an extra call.  Because his wife, her mobility is pretty poor.  So we’ve looked at the technology to make sure that they’re still maintaining a normal life, whereas the Komp is combatting the isolation, not seeing family, and being able to connect with family that they haven’t connected with for such a long time because of COVID as well.  
Int:	So it’s interesting because it’s almost like that was there happening, and this device obviously has been created for those things, and then COVID just really ramped up that need, even for a need that was a already there it sounds like.
R:	Absolutely, but it’s not so much them either, it’s allowing their family to see them.  So they might be suffering in the same way but haven’t got the means to get in touch with them.  Because if they can’t use the phone, they don’t have the smartphones, they can’t use a smartphone because they haven’t got dexterity either.  So that again is just increasing the loneliness of not being able to communicate with people.  
Int:	It sounds like you’ve had some really good feedback, but when you’re starting the roll out or perhaps you’re setting things up with a client in those early stages.  We know that there’s some barriers for older adults about a fear of having the technology and perhaps not wanting to break things or being afraid of the internet connectivity and things like that.  Have any issues like those fears and barriers come up for you in the beginning?
R:	Well we always get them with everything that we do.  Even though we’re [name of organisation] we come under [name of city] Social Services.  So as soon as that comes up people literally put up a barrier, they think you’re being nosey.  So we’ve got the privacy side of things as well that come up.  They don’t want us nosing in and they don’t want people interfering.  Then you’ve got the technology side of it.  “Oh gosh, you’re going to have people being able to know what I’m doing”.  There’s all these things about security.  So there is that. So we do come across that a lot.  They can’t fund it either, putting the internet in.  So there’s the cost of the funding.  So we’ve been working with our team in [name of city] as well to see whether we can look at addressing the cost of internet and being able to provide that as a one off for the installation.  
	So we’ve combatted some of these ones.  We’ve listened to what they’ve said.  Connectivity is one of the things, so we’re looking at trying to support them with that.  So the other one was that they couldn’t afford the cost of the Alexa, so we’re providing the Alexas.  So we’ve listened to what they’ve said over the last years and we’ve addressed it as we’ve been going along.  And that’s some of the things that we’ve looked at.  Because we started using their phones if they had a smartphone.  I started getting them to use that.  The proactive calls stopped with telecare, which was a lifeline, a welfare call.  So we were trying to replace the welfare call with something that we could use so someone still has that connection with the outside world.  So we’ve tried to work on that.
	So we had a lot of barriers with the technology when we first set that up.  So we knew what they were going to say before they could say it to us.  It’s almost like we were pre-empting because we started off with the welfare checks using technology.  So we’ve already come across those barriers and addressed them as we’ve been going along.  So we were almost ready for them to say “well yes, but we can do this for you or we can do that for you”.  So we were there ready with some of the answers.  I haven’t actually had too much objection with the older people, it’s been the younger people that I’ve had the barriers with.  Older people in their 90s and 80s have embraced the fact that we need to use technology to get online with other people.  
	So they were okay, they were open to it.  It’s the younger generation that were like “no, not having it, my privacy”.  They put the stop down.  So a lot of people we’ve come across with the younger generation, they’re the ones we can’t seem to get through to at the moment.  They don’t want it.  They won’t have the smartphones, they think they’re being tracked.  So they’re the ones that we find are going to be the hardest ones to get in touch with the technology as they get older.  And a lot of people that we see are disabled, so they are isolated anyway in different ways.  So I found the older ones more open to suggestions.  They seem to be more relaxed about it, which is interesting.
Int:	Yeah, that is interesting.  Why do you think that is?
R:	I think they’ve passed the whole like “oh well, if they don’t know it about me now that’s fine, we’ll just go along with it”.  But I think a lot of older people now, especially ones that live in [name of city], their families have moved away.  So they want to connect with them, they want to be able to speak with them, they want to be able to see their grandchildren.  So I think they’re more lonely, they’re the higher end of lonely.  So they’ll look at anything to try and connect with them.
Int:	So perhaps that need outweighs any worries or concerns they might have, the need is more important.  And so then the younger people that you struggle with more, and I know you said perhaps that’s more about the privacy.  Do you think that’s the main reason or do you think there’s any other reasons going on there?
R:	A lot of the older people think there’s a conspiracy against the internet.  I think that’s their barrier.  Because they’ve been brought up with technology, so they’re aware of what the technology can do.  They’re aware of what can happen.  So they’re more clued into things like that.  So whereas when I do the setup I have to explain to the older generation about the scam calls that people could potentially get, which the Komp can’t get by the way, they can’t get scam calls.  So that’s why they embrace the Komp because the family feel more secure with that setup.  So if you have the choice between the Alexa or the Komp, the Komp is probably going to be more secure for family to put in a person’s home than an Alexa.  So when you weigh it up I think that’s where they feel that there’s going to be the barrier.  
	But the Komp, the younger people don’t particularly like it either because they don’t like the idea of not being able to call out and people calling in.  So again it’s that people can come into your home and speak to you when they want, not when you want.  So that’s where we got the resistance with the younger generation on the Komp.  So we’ve only used it for the older people.
Int:	So it’s interesting balancing the different priorities or what might be a barrier and making it suit.  That must be tricky as well to play it right.  So in COVID then was there any other strategies or technology that came to mind for you as the professional?  You obviously already had those things planned in and you said you ramped up the priority of the Komp.  Was anything else brought into the mix to help with the loneliness?
R:	Not so much with that, because a lot of the befriending services stopped as well.  So we were given the opportunities, we snapped their hands off to get the Komp to help us with our older generation.  Other local authorities have tried other things as well.  They tried the Cradle, which is another device to combat isolation and loneliness as well.  That’s got a two way device with that one where they can ring in and ring out, which is one that we wanted.  And the Echo.  Again those ones are the ones that have been trialled throughout Monmouthshire at the moment, which is a big pilot that we’re trying to find the best device that we can use for technology.  So I’m not sure if you’ve got any information on [name of county in Wales] on what they’re doing at the moment with the different trials of technology.
	All the local authorities that are part of the [name of county in Wales] group, we’re all trying different ones, but I haven’t had any information about how that’s actually working at the moment for them.  Only that the Echo and the Cradle are working quite well, because they can do the two way talking.
Int:	So that might fit that gap perhaps that the Komp doesn’t have coming in.  
R:	Yeah, with the Komp it’s a big device, so it’s a big TV.  So that’s our plus side for us on that one.  Whereas the other ones are small devices, they’re about the size of the Alexas.  That’s the downside to them, so they’ve all got their ups and downs.  If we had the Komp with a calling out system as well it would be perfect.
Int:	So that would be the miracle tool for you at the moment.
R:	Yes, but they haven’t got that technology yet, and they have hit some hurdles with it as well.  But it’s all new so it’s all a learning curve.
Int:	So I guess when you were in the pandemic you would normally have been going face to face and you said that was what you had to stop doing, the visits and things.  What is the way around that, was it landline phone, that kind of communication, or how did you get around it?
R:	We did do some virtual assessments.  We tried a few different types of virtual assessments.  Some worked, some didn’t.  I know that when some of my colleagues tried doing the Teams calls like this connection was poor, connection was absolutely horrendous.  So they failed dramatically because as well a lot of the Teams didn’t work on mobile phones so they couldn’t maybe download the apps or the families couldn’t download them for them, or they didn’t have anybody there to do them.  So that technology just went flat.  The Teams did not work for outside of the professional capacity.  So a lot of us trialled WhatsApp because it was compatible with the mobile phone.  We could do the assessments and it worked absolutely brilliantly.  Obviously they had to have somebody else there with them to do it, however it worked better.  The clarity was better, you could see more and it was easier.
	We managed to get quite a lot of the assessments done that way.  And I know that some of our girls did some of them with the carers.  They used the WhatsApp with the carers.  That worked well as well.  So we did get around a lot of things but it was all trial and error in trying to get the right balance.  And was compatible with other people, because internet areas can be quite tricky sometimes.  
Int:	You are relying on both, it’s not just from your side is it, that’s the trouble.  So we were speaking before about some of the people who have those barriers and the kinds of things you used to get around that, or maybe how they can be persuaded.  Are there any experiences you’ve had where they’re just not wanting to engage with the technology, even after you’ve given them the reasons for it?  
R:	Yeah absolutely, it’s not for everybody.  A lot of people prefer that face to face.  They like that contact with people.  People don’t always like looking at a video screen because they’ve never done it before and they don’t want to do it.  We did have quite a few I’d say probably in their 40s and 50s that didn’t particularly want to have that.  They had the internet, they had the setup.  We were giving them the devices because we were gifting the devices to people.  So it wasn’t like they had to pay for it.  They didn’t even want the gift of having it set up for them.  Obviously I’d go out and set it up for them as well, so I was offering that service.  They didn’t have to get anybody else in and it was just a complete refusal.  They wanted that face to face, they wanted that contact.  So some people prefer the physical being in the same room as someone, and having that experience.
	So it’s not for everybody.  But again that was in that younger generation gap between 40s and 50s where they would have had at least some technology.  But they’re just really against the whole internet.  They don’t mind it for their TV to come through to watch their TV, their Netflix, but they didn’t want the whole people being able to see them.
Int:	That’s interesting, and are those people you would have said from in your professional capacity that were particularly isolated and lonely and it would have been useful?
R:	It would have been very useful yeah.  At the beginning as well providing the internet for somebody, the setup and the initial cost of things, we weren’t always able to do that.  That’s something that we’ve had to negotiate with over the past few months.  Because we’ve come up against this barrier, we could have potentially have provided more if we could have given the cost of the initial setup.  Obviously the payments then for the monthly payment for the cost of it we couldn’t address because that’s something that they would have to do.  But we managed to negotiate with [name of city] to be able to provide a one off installation fee to get that sorted out for them.  But even though we’re saying we can do that for them now, they’re like “no, still don’t want to have the internet” because they don’t want to pay the monthly cost.
Int:	So you’ve tried as far as you can.
R:	It’s down to money a lot of the time.
Int:	So it’s interesting that even when you’ve covered a lot of that there are still those ongoing barriers.  And I suppose that’s something because of like you say the maintenance of it and keeping it going.  Even if it could be manageable it’s difficult to commit to I suppose in the beginning.
R:	And we can’t just say “right, go with this provider”.  Legally we cannot say to somebody “you can go with this one”.  They have to go and make that choice for themselves.  We can give them the information.  We can sit there and research it with them and say “right, well there’s this, this and this one, this is how much these cost, but you have to choose”.  They don’t like making that choice because they don’t know if they’re making the right one.  We’re not allowed to say “go with this one, this is better” because we can’t be seen to be picking one over another.  That’s one thing I have found.  That if they had to make a choice of which internet provider they go with, then we can’t get involved in that.  We’ll help them with the initial setup but we can’t get involved with who they buy the internet with.
Int:	And then if they aren’t able to get that into place then you’re quite limited in moving forward aren’t you?
R:	Yes, and that’s some of the barriers that I’ve come across.  But I try to get them to let me speak to family.  So if they’ve given me consent to speak to family I can speak to say a son or a daughter and say “look, we can provide this if you can set up the internet”.  “We can provide you with the Alexa, set up the lights, the plugs, but we can’t get involved with the setup”.  The one I did yesterday, they did that for her and that worked because the family decided to put the internet in.  It was their choice who they chose.  So I didn’t have to get involved with all the costs of setup, so we didn’t need to do that because they were fully prepared to do it.  They were like “oh yes, we were going to do that for mum, but if you’re going to do that for her we’ll get that done straightaway”.  So it’s having that further conversation with families as well to see if they can support them.  And they were more than willing.  Sometimes it’s getting to speak to family because sometimes you don’t get the consent.  
Int:	And I suppose there’s a frustration there around the people who’ve got the family perhaps very involved and that are willing to help and speak to you and have that, versus perhaps the people that don’t and then you’re more likely to perhaps come across those barriers but perhaps they’re the people who need it even more.  
R:	But I’m stubborn so I do try my best.  I try every way to persuade them because it’s something that I know that once they’ve got it they will absolutely love it.  My mother-in-law is a classic example of this as well.  She wouldn’t use the phone.  Because we bought her a phone, we pay for her contract so that she can have a smartphone.  So we set that up for her.  She wouldn’t use the video calls, she wouldn’t use them.  So we’ve managed to persuade her to say “actually these are fine”.  She won’t come off it now.  So she’s constantly on there now.  Her daughter then set her up with Facebook and she’s constantly talking to her old friends.  She’s like “I spoke to so and so the other day”.  The feeling that you get from watching her getting that satisfaction of speaking to someone that she hasn’t seen in over 20 years is great.  It’s like “you should see their grandkids”.  So that side of it as well has been nice for her.  
	I try to explain that to a lot of people when I go out.  So I use my own experiences of the technology back in the community as well, and what I’ve learned I try to pass onto other people to say “if my mother in law, she’s 79, she can do it, you guys can do it”.  
Int:	That’s great, and so you mentioned there about initially not wanting to do it, but then she wants to do more things.  Are there any other unexpected positive effects that you’re aware of?  That perhaps you set something up and think “right, well this is going to do the things we intend it to do”.  But what are some of the other things that you hear about after?
R:	Well the one lady, the first one I ever set up with the Alexa.  This was before COVID.  The purpose for that one was mostly to try and reduce the amount of support she was getting as a way of care packaging, getting the hours down.  Because she had become so dependent on this person coming and writing out her lists, writing down her routine for the week.  They needed to get this dependency away from her because she needed to be independent.  So when we set the Alexa up originally for her it was just for reminders.  It was only just to try and give her more independence.  When I went to review it, I went back a few times to review it, and then she’d say to me “oh guess what I found on here, I can have books”.  Because her spelling wasn’t the best, so she found a way of making her shopping lists easier.  And she was able to listen to books because she couldn’t read.  So she was able to read books, the audio books through the Alexa.  And so didn’t think of that at the time because that wasn’t my objective originally.  But she’d found all these other things.
Int:	But that she found it by herself as well, or came across it on her own to come back to you that’s great.  
R:	Because with the Alexa, because it talks to you, when you start asking it questions it starts telling now.  It’ll say “have you tried this?”  “Try telling me this”.  So she was using that function to say “oh can you do this?”  And then she started thinking “oh I wonder if it can do that?”  So she started asking it questions and it was giving her the answers and telling her.  So she found lots of other things that she found useful on there as well.
Int:	That’s amazing.
R:	Which has helped me as well because I’ve passed that on.  So as I’m learning as well I’m passing that information on to more and more people, and they’re like “can you?”  “Yeah, go and ask it, ask those questions”.  But I bought one myself so that I could help other people.  So I find out a bit more about what it can do, so I’m constantly researching about different things that can help other people to do things.  
Int:	That’s really interesting, so you’re getting aware of more and more things from yourself but also from previous clients and building up a whole system.  
R:	So we do keep reviewing that lady because obviously she was one of our first ones.  So I do my case studies on her and how she’s progressing.  She’s due actually a call back in the next couple of months to see how she’s been going through lockdown and seeing how things have helped her through that.  So we’ll get the beginning and the end to find out how she has managed with it.
Int:	And so I suppose the flip side to that, and it might come out from some of your assessments and reviews and things, are there anything unexpected negative things that have come out of giving people the technology?
R:	For me the only negative is they keep calling you to fix things.  Because you’ve given it to them they want you to come out and fix things, whereas if they’d bought that for themselves they wouldn’t have had that support.  But we don’t mind so much because they’re under occupational therapy anyway, we would have had to support them in some way.  So we have to try and keep them updated with that.  Some of the ones that have just come through social work only, I think the only negative for them would be that they can’t always do everything they want it to do, it doesn’t always listen to them properly.  So their speech has got to be perfect.  So  the gentleman that’s got both the Komp and the Alexa, he doesn’t have to talk to the Komp so it just comes through.  With the Alexa his speech has to be perfect for it to be able to pick up.
	We set up the speech pattern up on him so it picks up on his speech pattern because he’s the one that uses it the most.  But then his wife can’t because she’s got reduce speech too.  So I would say that’s probably the only negative is trying to get it to understand you.  Older people can find that very frustrating if it doesn’t listen to them properly.  They have to understand that they have to use a command word every time they ask it a question.  So that’s a little bit of a negative as well from the Alexa is to actually wake it up they have to use a command word.  It’s not going to be listening in, which to us is good because they shouldn’t be listening in so the command word is important.  And that’s what I try to explain to people as well.  It won’t listen in to you if you don’t give it a command.  To try and combat that as well with some of the younger ones.  They’re like “no, it’s always listening in”.  
Int:	That’s an interesting one, so there’s a group of people that don’t want to have to use the command, and then some people that that might be a way in to say it’s a good thing.  You said about when things go wrong or if they’re calling in because something’s broken or whatever.  So is that your team that provides that technology support, or do you have to do that elsewhere or what do you do in those situations?
R:	Well at the moment we’ve having to supply the tech support ourselves.  But I am aware there is some tech support that we can get through I think it’s [name of county group].  They do offer tech support to teach people how to use the technology.  Again that started up in lockdown but then stopped because they couldn’t go out to visit people.  So that tech support went behind a little bit.  So at the moment if there is something that we’ve put in we’re offering that tech support.  We can go out and just sort things out.  But that can’t be something that we continuously do all the time.  So we would then ask the reach support, which is if they’ve got a support worker we would ask them if they can pop in, because they can pop in and out more often than what we can.  
	Because they’re obviously a lot cheaper as a resource than what we are.  We’re far more expensive than the support workers are.  So our time really is just to set it all up, get it all in there if they haven’t got it.  Because to do an initial setup is about two hours.  Whereas a normal visit for us would only be an hour.  But to set up the whole system for them is going to take two hours each time.
Int:	That’s interesting, it’s definitely an impact on your actual workout then isn’t it, doing this.  So you know the benefits it could bring, but that it is resource heavy in the beginning isn’t it?  
R:	It is yeah.  But once it’s done and it’s so rewarding as well.  That’s one thing I will say.  It may take two hours but I’ve sat there two hours with somebody that’s so appreciative of what you’re doing for them.  So for me to actually see that, to how happy they are when they can do things for themselves it’s great.  I just find it absolutely humbling really when you get that feeling that you’ve helped someone.  That two hours doesn’t matter anymore.  But obviously on the financial side of it for the team, but for me I don’t care.
Int:	That’s lovely.  
R:	It’s nice to see how it’s impacted them.
Int:	So it sounds like you go and do the reviews and you check on how things are going.  What do you think the plan is for that going forward to do evaluation of people’s loneliness or isolation in the context of the technology they’re using?  How does that look going forward?
R:	Well for the Komp side of things, because we’re working with [name of county group] alongside them.  So [name of county group] would interview them to find out how they found it.  So they will look to see if there’s any things that we can improve on.  So we’re looking to see how we can improve the service as well, if there’s anything else that we think that could actually add to that.  For the Alexas we check in on them just to see if things are working.  A lot of them have got open social work involvement so the social worker will put that in as part of their review.  “Is it working for you?”  “Is there anything else that you think we can do that could support you with that?”  Because the main thing is “is it working for them?”  “Is it going to support them to keep them from being isolated?”  At the moment a lot of people are enjoying the fact that they can do video calls, but the downside to the Alexa you can only do a video call if somebody else has got one.  
Int:	So you’re relying on that network already being there in some form, or that it’s going to be put in place from the other side.  
R:	With the Komp, the thing I like about that side of things, because we’ve been constantly evaluating the Komp as we’ve been going along to see how it works, what are the benefits of it because it’s a trial.  So we are being more proactive with trying to get that information back from the people.  Anybody can use it, download the app on their phone, the Komp app.  They just log into that Komp app and they can ring from wherever they are.  So they’re using their smartphone.
Int:	The other person doesn’t need the same thing.  So that’s good for the wider family and people like that isn’t it?  
R:	And whoever’s invited into that app can have the app, as long as that person gives consent for them to have that link.  The family with the main app can invite people, so if they have somebody that needs to do a doctor’s appointment they can invite the doctor to their mobile number to come in at a certain time and then take them off.  So it can be used for appointments, it can be used for that sort of thing.  Whereas the Alexa can’t.  So weighing them up for us on an evaluation side the Komp seems to be more flexible to be able to keep that person involved with the family.  The daughter in [name of city] or the daughter in [name of city] can have that app wherever they are and still ring in.  They don’t need to have the same device.
Int:	That makes sense.  And so it sounds like you’ve got some quite concrete ways of doing that evaluation.  Like you say because it’s part of a trial so it’s a bit more formal.  So it sounded like your work practice changed in terms of not being able to go out physically when the lockdown was happening and the limitations on the visits and stuff.  Do you see any changes to that going forward now with technology?  That you would keep up more phone calls rather than going, or do you see it more staying face to face?
R:	Personally I prefer face to face when I do my visits.  Because we didn’t stop visiting urgent patients.  We continued seeing urgent patients, so palliative patients, terminal patients.  We continued to see them.  It was the non-urgent really, the routine appointments, somebody with limited mobility that still are okay, still can get about, but just limited on what they can do in the home.  So to see a palliative patient we carried on with those.  But to see somebody in an [Interviewee’s work title] sense you need to see their environment.  You can’t get that through a video call.  So for me even though I love technology and I embrace it more so than anybody in my team, because I like what it can do.  I like the fact that we can hook it up to the lights and hook it up to the plugs.  
	So for me I’m very much there, so for me to say “I don’t like it for my assessments” you don’t get a feel of a person via a video call.  Because body language is everything for me.  You see a lot more from somebody’s body language.  And if you’re trying to speak to an older person who’s stubborn, who wouldn’t necessarily show you how they do things properly because they’re on a video call and they feel like they have to be on their best behaviour.  When they’re in their own home environment you see more.  You see a lot more.  So for me no, I don’t think video assessments or technology is going to work in an [Interviewee’s work title] stance.
	Not sure about social.  Some of the social workers have done video calls, they’re not happy because they can’t see all of the rooms.  Whereas they’re looking and they’re checking the environment as well.  So you’re missing things.  And other feedback, because I’ve asked people in the social work team how they felt about doing the video calls because I’m nosey and I like to know what’s going on.  I just wanted to get a feel how they managed and how they felt.  They again have also said that for social work you miss lots.  You miss a lot of what’s going on in someone’s environment.  For me when I go out on my assessments now, I’ve done a couple of non-urgent [inaudible 48:57] ended up putting in technology.  Because I can see that they’re struggling and they’re not seeing people.  They’ll talk to you, they’ll open up more.
	And I’ll say “oh have you tried this?”  And they’re like “no”.  So you can pick up more, you can provide more [inaudible 49:15].  So I’ve probably installed more Alexas now I’ve been out visiting more people that are non-urgent, getting them involved in the technology.  Using it for other things as well.  So I think for me it’s more about getting them to use the technology in a different way to what we would want to use it for.  But for assessments no, I can’t see it.  If it was a GP appointment doing it via Attend anyway, yes I think you can if it’s just for the minor elements of things like coughs or flus.  They can see the person, they can check out what they look like.  Because that’s going to be a face to face what they see anyway isn’t it?  Mobility wise they don’t particularly get involved in that anyway.  
Int:	So you can see the benefits in different parts of what needs to be done, but for you specifically and that social work side it’s much more about the physical being there and taking everything else in.
R:	Yeah, because we look at the whole environment.  So when I was doing my first technology assessments over the phone I researched the property.  I looked on Google Earth, I looked at the maps and I scanned in first before.  So I could see what the front of the house looked like, and I could see most of what the environment looked like initially.  And then when we went inside I got them to show me around the house as well.  Because I could see what the house looked like, because I needed to see, because that’s what we do.  But it still didn’t really work.  I did end up [inaudible 50:51].
Int:	You were doing more beforehand and more trying to fill in the gaps almost than you would get if you just were able to go and have a look.  
R:	If we’re going to provide major adaptions we have to look at what the outside environment looks like as well.  We need to see whether there’s lots of steps out there, especially with social housing.  It’s whether or not we provide them with those adaptations or not.  Because if we gave them an adaptation and didn’t see what the outside of the house looked like, they might be able to use it inside but they can’t get out.  So it defeats the object.
Int:	So you need that whole approach.  That’s really interesting.  Well thank you, that’s pretty much all my questions.  Thank you so much.  You’ve given me so much information there, you’ve got so much experience of doing this, it’s really interesting.  Was there anything else you wanted to share or tell me about, or anything that you wanted to ask?
R:	I don’t think so, because obviously a lot of the things I’ve gone over anyway.  Because obviously I keep in touch with a lot of my Komp users because I’ve heading that with [name of city] anyway.  So I like to keep in touch with them all and see how they’re all getting on.  And if anybody’s got problems I’m here to help them with the support and get the support in.  More about the Komp really, I know I can answer those, but I do get to keep that one, especially as it could be rolled out throughout the UK then and it could help more people.
Int:	It’ll be interesting to see if it does pop up more places and people are also finding that same benefit definitely.  So thank you so much for taking the time this morning.  That’s so helpful, you’ve given us loads.  So I don’t know if on your survey whether you had anything else that you’d said that you wanted to get a summary of the findings.  I think there was a box for that, did you want to be kept updated?
R:	Yeah, that would be great if I could.  Because have you got other people that you’re interviewing as well with regards to the technology from different areas?
Int:	Yeah, so actually from all across Wales.  So we’ll hear from different kinds of experiences from different areas, so that will be interesting.  And then there’s a focus in there on the lockdowns about how things have changed from before and after and going forward as well.  So hoping to get things all put together to feed back.  
R:	It’ll be interesting to see how other people have managed to do it as well, and whether they’ve done it any better, or things that we can draw upon as well, it would be quite nice to know.
Int:	Definitely, well thank you.
R:	Always open to suggestions.
Int:	Well that’s how we learn.  That reminded me of when you were saying about hearing from the lady that you’d given one to and she was telling you the things that the Alexa could do that you didn’t know.  It’s great isn’t it, it’s great to hear about it, great to hear the examples.  
R:	Of course yeah, and especially if other areas have done it differently to us, and whether they’ve got other ways that they’ve managed to help the elderly in their areas.  Because I know that our [name of organisation] have also got the Alexas and they’ve been rolling them out.  So we worked quite closely with [name of organisation].  So I know they’ve been doing it as well because they’ve learned from ours.  So they’ve taken on what we’ve been doing and they’re doing it as well.  So for [name of city] Alexa seems to have just shot out everywhere.  It’s no wonder Amazon have managed to earn billions.  
Int:	Yeah, you’re sorting that out for them aren’t you by the sounds of it.
R:	Yeah, we’re just putting in their money.
Int:	That’s brilliant.  Thank you so much.
R:	Pleasure.
Int:	Lovely to meet you anyway.  You take care, thank you, bye.
R:	Bye.

R:	… which is [name of organisation], and it’s a [type of organisation]. So, our organisation encourages volunteering and support for third sector organisations in terms of funding, structure, research and any support that we can offer our third sector colleagues really in [name of city]. So, my project then is connected communities, which has grown over the last five years from having a team of community connectors that support individuals to connect them to information and advice, activities, we’ve now expanded the team so we’ve got a connector for children and families and a connector for dementia supported communities.
	At the start of Covid when we suddenly realised that we had to work from home and our community work had to change and our approach to how engaged with people had to change, we added digital to the roles. So, all the connectors swiftly went onto offering support to individuals at a time when our third sector colleagues were offering a range of digital activities that would usually happen in a face to face community hall type event, we quickly thought we’ve got to be able to support people here who haven’t got the technology, haven’t got the knowledge, haven’t got broadband, haven’t got equipment to be able to take advantage of what was available online. 
	So, looking for funding, we approached our GP clusters who had some funding and really liked the idea that we were able to combine activities and services with also new technology and new advances in how people could approach and contact their GP. So, through the funding we were able to invest in purchasing some tablets, some broadband My WiFi boxes, and so through encouraging individuals, some who had never used a digital tablet before, and bearing in mind the difficulties of getting somebody who’s never used a tablet before, getting the tablet delivered to them, social distancing and also helping with instructions via WhatsApp, via the telephone wasn’t an easy process. But we got there with a lot of people, a lot of people who had never accessed digital before, and so we were able to connect people really to a whole range of local activities and services, but also the health benefits as well, so being able to use things like e-consult, for instance, having their prescriptions reordered online, and being able to speak to their consultants through Zoom as well, and WhatsApp has been a huge transformation for a lot of people. 
Int:	Wow, OK, that sounds really good. 
R:	So, that was basically in a nutshell. We also had a strong partnership with our local authority and the health board, so we had support from them. And also, we realised that we didn’t have a digital strategy in [name of city], so we also worked with our partners to look at a digital provider forum of organisations that could provide digital support. We also looked at then how we could support communities with a community kit, so we accessed some funding to be able to loan community kit out to village halls, community groups, so that they could also encourage people to go online. And some of this was done at the very start of Covid when we were isolated, but also coming out into small bubbles, we were able to look at some outside activities, some village hall activities where people were social distanced but keeping in line with the regulations of open windows and keeping distance and things like that. 
Int:	Wow, thank you, that’s a brilliant summary of everything you’ve done, that’s fab. So, just to go back on a couple of those bits, the digital side of things, if I understand correctly, wasn’t really there before, and then when Covid hit that became the real focus?
R:	Yeah. 
Int:	And so, you said about the health link within that, that that was where the GP side of it was able to bring it into play, but how much then was the focus on loneliness and social isolation within that as well?
R:	That was the big thing. For some, carers for instance, who were very isolated and lonely, suddenly digital was able to transform their caring duties. Whereas perhaps they felt really isolated before Covid, suddenly they were able to access a range of activities and also have peer support, mentor support from individuals that were carers themselves. So, for some people it opened up a whole new world for people. Individuals themselves were able to feel part of a group, we set up craft groups as well through the connector project so people could get together, sharing a shared hobby and interest and get together online. So, all of that made people less isolated, perhaps less depressed, improved their wellbeing. So, yeah, it had a huge impact. 
Int:	You said then about the carers, that’s obviously a key group that it was really, really beneficial for. And so, within the other people that were engaging and that took it on and attended things, what other kinds of groups of people was it positive for?
R:	I think older people who perhaps had transport issues or maybe couldn’t get to perhaps some events that, you know, like an art group. Instead of having to get on a bus and travel to [name of town], which is the main town in [name of city], they could take part from the comfort of their home. So, it meant if they had a  mobility problem or if they had a transport issue, say they didn’t drive anymore and maybe didn’t have the confidence to use a bus, then it meant that they were still able to take part. So, people who had Covid or people who were isolating, it meant that they could still be involved and still feel a part of a group. 
Int:	And so I suppose the flipside to that then, were you aware of particular groups of people who didn’t engage or who found it more difficult to engage with the digital side?
R:	Yeah, there’s certainly access issues, accessibility, people with hearing or sight loss. I think to be fair, I think that cohort of people were severely overlooked in a range of services at the start of Covid. We would normally have a leaflet that would be perhaps easy read, it would be a certain font size, all that went out the window really with Covid because we weren’t distributing, we weren’t out in the community distributing information to people. So, because it went online, people really didn’t have access or knew how to access it, so I think that cohort of people who had sensory loss, it certainly impacted on them.
Int:	Yeah, and like you say, it’s almost a vicious circle because even if you want them to be engaged, the restrictions meant it was so difficult to actually get things out, wasn’t it?
R:	Yeah. 
Int:	And so, when you were thinking back to when that first realisation was happening and the restrictions were in place and they were thinking, ooh, what kind of conversations were being had in your organisation about what can be done and what might be pros and cons be before it was rolled out?
R:	Well, the other thing as well is the team had never offered digital training themselves. So, although they were very capable of doing a range of different platforms, well saying that, none of us had actually used Zoom before Covid, so we were learning ourselves, so we went from using perhaps Skype occasionally or WhatsApp, we went on to be quite proficient in the end on using Zoom and Teams and the other things that we could use. So, there was a big learning curve for the staff, the connectors to consider themselves as being able to share their knowledge with others, so they upskilled themselves and took part in as many pre-Zoom sessions that they could. So, they attended things like how to engage with people online, how to offer support to people regarding accessibility, and they did a range of different courses and whatever they could lay their hands on really, they did. So, that was the first thing to acknowledge, that we had to upskill the staff. 
	We were lucky in that our organisation had prepared us for being agile workers, so we all had tablets, we all had mobile phones, we all had laptops, so we were equipped with equipment to work from home. And so then we realised we were in that position that we were able to work from home, but a lot of people, a lot of organisations weren’t. So, that was when we realised that there needed to be some support out there now for organisations that hadn’t got a digital strategy in place, hadn’t equipped their volunteers or staff with equipment, which is where the community loan then came from, and then individuals then, because obviously we would normally see people face to face, part of our conversation, our guided conversation, our what matters conversation with individuals asked the question then, are you digitally active, have you got broadband. And so, we started asking those questions which then enabled us then to build up a picture of how many people actually were isolated because they didn’t have the equipment. So, then we thought, well, we’ve got to do something about this, which is when we started to look for funding. 
Int:	Yeah, that’s really interesting, so you actually were able to identify people through those conversations that you were routinely having. And so, what was the statistics like, what were the amounts of people who were digitally included already?
R:	It was about 80% didn’t have access to a smartphone or a tablet or had broadband. That was the biggest one, was because we live in a rural area, a lot of people didn’t have good broadband. And so, by giving people the mobile box, it meant they could move it around the house, if you like, so they could perhaps have the box upstairs which enabled them to have broadband access. And it was a learning curve for all of us really because some areas were better at receiving broadband than others, so we had to face with the rurality of [name of city] as well as people never having a need to access data from their homes. Usually perhaps many people would go into a library and have access to equipment and broadband there. Well of course when the libraries shut, they didn’t have that, a lot of people would use a village hall and use the broadband there, and of course with lockdown that wasn’t possible. So, yeah, about 80% of our individuals didn’t have broadband or equipment to access. 
Int:	And so, when you were having those, I guess after those conversations then the suggestions would come from your side about why don’t we do this, why don’t we try this. What were some of the, if you were met with people who were maybe a bit resistant or maybe weren’t keen to engage with the digital side, what were some of those reasons, what was going on for those people? Or maybe you didn’t have any. 
R:	Yeah, there was the typical one that everybody says, I’m too old to start now. Also, surprisingly enough, it was family members that were not very encouraging. We came across a lot of family members who were worried that they would be perhaps scammed and they didn’t want their parents or grandparents to perhaps have access to technology in case, they were frightened that they might be scammed because they wouldn’t be aware of what could happen. A lot of family members had skills but they didn’t have the patience to share with others, so that was quite frustrating. 
	But for a lot of people they just gave it a go, and for some people it did transform their lives. And it wasn’t so much about, we were able to set up an email address for each of the tablets that we loaned out, but that wasn’t so much for them to be sending emails, receiving emails, it was more for them so that we could monitor the tablets to ensure that they were located where they should be and that they were switched on, or we could just monitor whether they were being used. So, things like using the camera for instance, just something simple like that was an eye opener for a lot of people. So, we gave them tasks to do, things like if you go for a walk, take your tablet with you, walk to the end of the road and take a picture of anything red or anything yellow, and it just then encouraged people to get out the house to do something, so it encouraged mobility, it encouraged them to just look around, and just gave them a lovely feeling of wellbeing really.
	So, we tended to use the five ways to wellbeing as our base for encouraging people to use technology, so taking notice, listening to music, keeping active, YouTube was fantastic in a way of getting people to maybe take part in yoga classes, so look at gardening programmes, that type of thing. Borrow Box was another one that we encouraged people to use so that they could use the library to borrow books to read. Games was a good one to encourage people to use techniques, so word searches encouraged people to learn how to swipe and to tap. A lot of older people found it difficult with their index finger, and I don’t know whether that’s because the skin is drier, but they found it difficult to tap and swipe, so we found by using games like jigsaws and word search that enabled people to learn those skills. So, we learnt a lot really from setting up the project. 
Int:	That’s interesting you were saying about that sometimes it’s the family members that sometimes were a little bit resistant, and I suppose it makes this sort of sense of a vicious circle with some of the people who were perhaps isolated from their family, or everybody was to an extent, but that that might be a key reason that they might want to have the technology to maybe do video calls and things, but then perhaps if the family are not so engaged it’s quite difficult then. So, did you have some of those situations where the technology was primarily for contact with family and that was something that was being promoted?
R:	Yeah. Yeah, a lot of family living away, they were then then able to join through WhatsApp and Facebook, and it did enable people to contact and have those family conversations and gatherings. And new babies could be introduced to the older families, and yeah, contact with family was really important.
Int:	Yeah, and so that sense as well that you were saying, because I was going to ask about that, about the fear of scams and internet and that kind of security, so you said that was quite often coming from the family again. Was that coming from the older adults themselves as well?
R:	I think because they were ignorant of what could happen, so we did go through some of the issues really and the safety of being careful online, online safety. So, we did go through that with them, and for most people we didn’t go through using emails with people because for them, it wasn’t needed, it wasn’t something they wanted. They didn’t want to use the tablet for online shopping, for instance. For some they did, but others then it was just a case of using applications they needed an email address for but they weren’t going to be using emails for online shopping, which I think is the biggest threat, isn’t it, for scams. 
Int:	Again when you were saying that you were able to provide the WiFI and the access to internet for people who didn’t have it already, I know that it’s quite interesting you say about the rural area, so the geographical side of things, because we’re talking to people from all over Wales and it’s an interesting point about the actual area where you’re based being quite relevant in not only how people can access the internet, but then on top of that, presumably how isolated or lonely they might have been or might be anyway. So, did you find that there was any differences in who was more keen or maybe who had more success in terms of whether they were more rural or nearer to the towns?
R:	No, we had people who were very isolated in rural areas as well as we had people, loneliness, you can be lonely living in a sheltered housing, can’t you, if you don’t see anybody, and that was the thing, I think, people were … Oh excuse me, I’ve got a cough. Bear with me a second, I’m just going to get a drink. 
Int:	No worries. 
R:	Sorry about that, something went down the wrong way, I think. 
Int:	Don’t worry, I’m the same at the moment. 
R:	We have people in sheltered housing and residential homes who, although seeing people every day, felt very isolated from their families and friends. And I think that was a big thing as well with residential homes, staff didn’t have the time but also didn’t have the skills to help people. And one of the things that I’ve suggested throughout [name of city] digital work is that staff have to be digitally enabled to help others. Now, I don’t think it’s a good way for the workforce to not be able to help people to be digitally active, and I think it’s really important for residential homes, looking at the future, that all staff can help people, not just with physical mobility and things like that, I think they need to include digital in their work. 
Int:	Yeah, and like you say, the residential situation with not being able to have visitors, it’s a massive impact, massive change for people, and you can see going forward, even now we’re in a bit of a funny time, aren’t we, but to have that there as an alternative that they could just do a remote visit and that that could be set up as part of it, you can see that that would be really beneficial. 
R:	Yeah. 
Int:	And I suppose if it’s something that people were more able to do and it was just quite accessible then it would become a little bit more normal, wouldn’t it, and the clients themselves would be more likely to get on board.
R:	Yeah. I mean, when you think about it, I think it was quite sad really that people all could have had digital conversations with their families, they could have been taken into a lovely private room, they could have had a big screen with their family members on, and I just think that was such a missed opportunity for residential homes. 
Int:	Yeah, it’s something about the lessons learned, isn’t it, for if it was to ever happen again, I suppose. 
R:	Yeah. 
Int:	And when people were, I’m just thinking you said about was it the tablets and the internet access were the main hardware that you were giving out?
R:	Yeah. 
Int:	And so, what were some of the technical problems, technical difficulties that came about? Did you have to deal with any of that?
R:	Yeah, just switching something on and off. Plugging something in to keep it charged up. Yeah, just basic things which I think the on off one was the biggest one because people just didn’t realise where the on off buttons were, they didn’t know that they would have to charge it up. So, those simple things for people with no technology in the house was one of the biggest things. 
Int:	Would they phone up the service and then it would be for your colleagues to …?
R:	Yeah, they would ring up and they would say, ‘There’s something wrong, the battery’s gone flat’, and then because we had a system where we could tell when it was switched on and when it was switched off, and then we could see that it hadn’t been switched on for a couple of days, and then they would say, ‘Yeah, well it hasn’t worked for a couple of days because there’s something wrong with it’. So, then we would say, ‘Well, have you switched it on with the charger?’ and the charger would still be in the box and they hadn’t realised that they’d have to charge it up. So, things like that happened a lot. 
Int:	Just thinking then about when you were saying that you had the sort of groups that were running digitally that would have been happening in person before, what was the uptake in terms of numbers of what you would have had previously face to face, to the people who then carried on digitally and were keen to do it?
R:	We didn’t have a digital project before Covid, we relied on organisations like [digitally based organisation] to do that piece of work, so digital wasn’t on our radar at all. It was only through Covid really that we suddenly thought, actually we need to step up the game now and do something. So, we didn’t have any online classes before. In January now we’re planning to go out in communities, hopefully, and one of the things we’re going to be doing is looking at digital activities in partnership with some of our other organisations. We’ve got housing organisations that have got wellbeing budgets, they’ve got access to digital as well, so we need to really get out there now and push the digital agenda. 
Int:	Do you foresee there being particular groups or particular areas of people that you might need to work on more with that, that might need a bit more encouragement or more persuasion?
R:	Yeah, I think it will be older people. I think people with learning difficulties as well, we’ve supported some people older and people with learning difficulties who would normally attend a day centre, those services are changing so it’s how do we manage those people to be part of groups and activities moving forward to prevent loneliness and isolation. Yeah, so it’s going to be about how do we manage those people who would normally attend a day centre to get back out in the communities. So, yeah, it’s going to be using all sorts of ways of connecting with volunteers, encouraging volunteer recruitment of people with digital skills so that we can make sure that every community has access to digital.
Int:	And that’s interesting because that is what you’re reliant on as well the volunteers to have the ability and the skills to then be able to provide it onwards, isn’t it, so it’s a little bit of a team. 
R:	Yeah. 
Int:	That’s obviously something you’re going to be focusing on in the new year, so going forward, I’m asking people this question and it’s a bit difficult because we are feeling a sense of things might change again, but the balance of face to face versus digital, what do you think that looks like then in the future now?
R:	For some people we’ll be able to access people through things like WhatsApp. I think online meetings will perhaps happen over Zoom. But what we really need to have is that face to face approach which can give us that balance then of face to face instruction, encouragement, getting people online with then the mix then of being able to connect those people with others from across the county rather than whereas normally we would keep people within their own communities connected, with digital you can connect with anybody anywhere, can’t you. So, I think we will see a balance really and a mix of connecting people with one another online and face to face. 
Int:	That’s interesting and it sounds like there’s that bit of being able to do the face to face in the early stages to get everything set up and perhaps get that confidence is quite vital for what comes later. And I guess that’s the bit that we didn’t have with the pandemic, there wasn’t that chance. 
R:	No. 
Int:	And it’s going back to that, so I guess when you think forward it’s nice to think maybe we could put that in place and have it a bit more organised. 
R:	Yeah. 
Int:	You’ve mentioned quite a few things about the feedback you’ve had from individuals and from the volunteers and how things have gone, but have you done any kind of formal evaluation of how the role out of the different digital projects has gone?
R:	No, one of the things that we’re really poor at, I think, is demonstrating impact. So, although as I mentioned we’ve got an email address for every tablet, we have sent surveys and some of those surveys have come back and everybody has said how much better they’ve all felt from using a digital tablet and being able to connect with people. We’ve also used stories as a way to evaluate the project, so we use a technique called most significant change, which has been through our partnership with [name of university and doctor], and it’s a way of showing how change has been significant in their lives. We’ve collected quite a few stories, so for somebody who perhaps sat in a room all day, I’m just looking at one now, she sat in her room all day not talking much to anybody, including her husband and her son, due to her anxiety and depression. Her arthritis meant that she couldn’t get about easily, she couldn’t take part in things and the pain got her down. But once she got involved with an online group through [name of group], that helped her. She then was introduced to an online expected [name of craft group], so she got to meet other people, likeminded people, she then joined another group that offered five days a week of activity, including art, quizzes, photography walks, and then she also joined an online garden group to rekindle her love of gardening. So, all of that is put into a story, so it demonstrates really how the impact of introducing her to new people, ideas and possibilities, having a tablet has helped her to be more included, research new ideas and keep in touch with people more easily. So, it’s inspired her to challenge herself and do things she would never have to do before, and as she says in her own words, she’s keeping herself occupied and hopeful about the future and is making a comeback to life. So, all of those things are written in her own words because it’s her story. 
Int:	That’s amazing ways of getting people to feed it back. It’s interesting because I think you probably had this on the survey that you did, but we’re interested in getting some case study examples from people, so something like that would be amazing. We have a template but if you’ve got them already written, that’s perfect. 
R:	I have, yeah. I’ve got another one who, again a gentleman who was being seen by Mind. He obviously didn’t have a tablet because what he used to use was the library. So, he borrowed one of our tablets, he didn’t think he wanted to meet people online but he agreed to give it a go. So, he had an old school phone, no computer, so grateful to get the tablet to have a go and reconnect with people. He used Zoom for the first time, which he found an amazing experience, week by week he got more confident from interacting with people in the Zoom meetings, he joined an intergenerational course through Mind, talking to people with different ages. He met younger people who had difficult experiences, he covered courses like grief and death and how to deal with it, he felt at peace with difficult things that had happened to him, and then he found the camera and listening to music on the tablet, which helped him. And then he started using the camera outdoors, so he would go on walks and take photos. He then found a green area near to where he lived where it was very unkempt. So, he asked the council if he could cut the grass. He cut the grass and he cut it in a way that he left the letters NHS and H-O-P-E, and he looks after this area now. So, the photographs have been shared on Facebook, local authority have shared them because it makes people happy. So, the council now appreciate him doing it, he’s got involved now talking to the older councillors that are in his community, and he feels as if, as he says in his words, he’s changed the world in a small way. So, it’s all things like that. 
Int:	Oh, that’s lovely. 
R:	That’s somebody’s story and it’s just impact. Moving forward people have recognised that he did a little bit to clear an area that was unkempt and now it’s become a little bit of a focal point and a talking point for that community. 
Int:	Yeah, and the effect that that would have on any isolation and the involvement of the technology in that as well from having that access to so many other things. 
R:	Yeah. 
Int:	It’s brilliant, that’s amazing to have that feedback. Is this something then that you see continuing, gathering the stories and gathering that feedback, or have you got any other plans to get feedback?
R:	Yeah, we use the stories because these stories are collected and then they’re given to a panel of commissioners, so they’re not just stories collected, shared and then left, they’re actually given to commissioners of services. So, if somebody is perhaps, he’s perhaps a commissioner of adult social care and really understanding what a story means to people and what that significant change is, it’s the small things that can make a big difference, so it perhaps gives them an idea really about what they can do and, when they’re commissioning services, to maybe consider the impact it makes to people and it has on people. So, that’s been good, so it’s been a good process really. 
Int:	Yeah, it’s a very effective, very impactful way of doing it, for sure, and there’s nothing, you can have numbers and lists, cant you, but there’s nothing like a story. 
R:	Exactly. 
[section removed for confidentiality]
Int:	Was there anything else you wanted to share or anything?
R:	No, I don’t think so. There has been a launch, I noticed only yesterday on social media, I think it’s called [name of group]]. Yeah, I’ll send you the link. I saw that it was launched on Twitter yesterday. Hang on, let me just find it. I think I have to send you the link because it’s taking forever to come up. I think it’s [name], it’s a new project to look at digital in Wales. Yeah, [name] has just been launched to offer digital support to third sector, and it’s through the [name of organisation]. So, I think it’s partnership with [name] as well and [name], so it might be worth having a look at that. 
Int:	Yeah, brilliant, yeah. It sounds like there’s a lot going on all the time and I think over the last couple of years it’s just increased it massively as well, hasn’t it. 
R:	Yeah, yeah. 
Int:	Well, thank you very much, thank you very much for talking to me today. 
R:	No problem at all. 
Int:	if you’re able to send over those bits, that would be absolutely brilliant. 
R:	I will. 
Int:	Thank you so much.

R:	I work for [name of organisation] and I’m [work title], which my kind of area that I focus on, there’s five or six different areas that my teams work on, for the purpose of this interview it will probably be more highlighted and focused on the digital support that we provide as well, so we’ve got a digital support team established working across the city, but I also [work within] our adult learning team, [work within] our volunteering provision that we provide as well, and a team that is called [name of team] but what they do is they support individuals who work for [name of organisation] upskill in some capacity. But I work in a wider team or I’ve worked within [advice] service, which primarily supports individuals who are living in the [name of city] area move back into employment. Predominantly the customers that we engage with on that side of our services are in poverty in some situation, they’re either looking to find employment, upskill to find more employment opportunities, or look to just develop their skillset in readiness for when they are looking to move back into employment.   
Int:	Within that then, how many of those people that you’re working with often are older adults, would you say?
R:	So, the way the team is split, our digital support team predominantly, I don’t know, you’re from Bath, aren’t you? Yeah, so in the [name of city] area we have [a certain area] which is predominantly very low in poverty, ethnically diverse and stuff like that, but our digital team, over the last year or so we’ve really focused on working in [another area of the city], which is primarily for an older demographic of individuals. So, of course tackling social isolation, older individuals who have been shielding in some capacity and who may be cut off from their normal kind of activities, is what we targeted way back when we started to reshape the team. But additionally, like our employability teams are split into, so we have a team that supports 16-24 year olds and a team that supports 25 plus as well. And then we have drop in facilities, sorry, my phone’s going like mad back there and I don’t know why. We have a team that supports individuals just dropping in on our facilities. The demographic is quite wide and varied though, I wouldn’t say we have a specific targeted over 55 kind of team. We do work, and I don’t know if you’ll be interviewing anyone, we do have [another service] that support people who are generally of a, they do support a wider demographic than this but they do support individuals who are over 55 and socially isolated as well, which is managed by one of our colleagues in the local authority as well. So, we do try and work in partnership with their team as well.
Int:	OK, so you were saying there about targeting the different areas and the people within that with the slightly different issues. So, how much generally then is the focus on preventing loneliness and social isolation in everything that’s happening?
R:	It is a focus and it’s been a key focus, but at the same time, all individuals have become a bit of a key focus, so ensuring that we are trying to support people who do need the support essentially, but that was one thing that we weren’t, one thing, that’s a terrible way of describing it, that is one area that we weren’t really primarily focused on prior to the pandemic, but obviously the course and the realities of individuals, I think in [name of city] 8000 people were advised to shield at the onset of the pandemic, which meant that they weren’t accessing our support, so I was kind of repurposed to helping out with a food parcel delivery service for people who were shielding, but then we also started developing a tablet gifting scheme [sounds like 04:01] for individuals as well, trying to buy data for individuals, and then trying to somehow, in some way, develop people’s digital skills from distance, which proved fairly difficult. Obviously over the last year or so we have been able to get back out in the community and raise our profile in some capacity, but yeah, it became a much more significant focus for our service area. Traditionally we would support anybody who was in poverty more than anybody who was socially isolated, but then with the way the team has expanded and the focuses have changed, it has become  a priority for us. 
Int:	Yeah, that makes sense, so it was hand in hand with the pandemic response as well that that came about?
R:	100%, yeah, yeah. 
Int:	You mentioned then about you had a tablet gifting scheme and there was internet access. Can you just tell me a bit more then about the digital stuff that was going on, the kind of things that happened in response to the pandemic?
R:	Yeah, so we [inaudible 05:02] to some of our grant funding, again internally and externally applying for opportunities, we created an accessible tablet gifting scheme for individuals who met a certain criteria, people who were socially isolated or unable to access, shielding, people in poverty, looking to get back into work, there was a wide criteria to it. So, I don’t want to just say that we were targeting socially isolated people but again that was something that we incorporated within this. Prior to the pandemic I don’t think we would have ever considered anybody socially isolated. So, yeah, there was a simple application form, we run a bit of a publicity campaign, I think we posted it on our social media pages, or [name of organisation] social media pages, and the uptake instantly was through the roof, which was good but again, I don’t want to describe it as such but it may have been the wrong kind of client group, because our promotion was via social media, now anybody, most individuals who would have seen it on social media would have had some sort of, might not have been isolated. So, we did have to kind of re-examine how we were doing that, so we worked with our key partners, third sector organisations in the local area to try and support individuals who were the key demographic, who were isolated. We contacted community groups and our anchor organisations [sounds like 06:25] as well and our mutual aid groups that were established during the pandemic as well to see if we could promote it that way rather than just saying, ‘Look, here we go, everyone can apply’, we were trying to link in with the partners who were offering tablet gifting schemes, such as colleges, if there was an 18 year old who did want to apply, so we were trying to signpost to other services where applicable, and again, just try and support the key demographic, which was, to be honest, the gap in provision where we found or certainly I found or our team found in terms of people who weren’t able to access tablet gifting schemes were people who were socially isolated, generally, so that was the kind of area that we did focus on pretty much from the outset. And it’s still going on, we are still providing the tablet gifting scheme as well. 
Int:	What about the internet access, is that something that people had already or needed help with?
R:	No. So, again, a lot of people needed help with internet access, so we provided three month data and then again trying to access different pots of funding for people who didn’t have a telephone line or didn’t have internet access in their home because, again, it may be standard for all of us to just jump on and you have a phone line and you set up your internet access, but a lot of people weren’t aware of that sort of stuff. So, yeah, we did have to purchase that and then again of course three months down the line that would cause a few other complications, so we were looking for solutions for that as well, which kind of have  been rectified as well, we are trying to work with a lot of other organisations who are maybe able to access funding that we’re unable to do so. The challenge then again was to ensure that individuals were able to A, know how to use the tablet rather than it just growing dust, and then understanding how to use Teams and Zoom and stuff like that. So, we were providing a telephone service on the onset because our teams aren’t home visiting teams, so we were providing a telephone service. And there’s two things that I say I can’t train or teach anyone, I can’t teach anyone how to speak English or write English because you don’t remember how you learn it, and the same with a computer, I grew up around a computer, so that brought a different set of challenges for the team. So, we did have to reshape how we were delivering, what the expectations of the team were for the first up until, probably up util the end of last summer really. Well, maybe not actually, a little bit longer, probably up until the start of spring this year where the team really started to change in terms of when we were back out in community facilities. We were trying to link in or refer individuals to other organisations who could take on visits, which would not just ease it on us, I don’t want to describe it that way, but the individual was also getting very frustrated with like, when you say, ‘Press this button’, I could tell you, it’s easy, it’s easy for me to press that button, but at the same time it’s not so much for somebody who has been digitally excluded all their lives, essentially.
Int:	Yeah, and it’s a specific thing all of its own, isn’t it, and I think that comes to light quite quickly it sounds like. So, the uptake that you had, the people that were engaging with the tablet gifting and the internet access and that ongoing support, were there particular people, and I know we’re sort of specifically looking at older adults, but maybe within that, certain types of people, certain groups that were more engaging, or …?
R:	Certainly clients or our services in the north of the city have been much better accessed by an older demographic of individuals, which is what we wanted, but I wouldn’t say that there has been some disparity in terms of individuals who are engaging ourselves, they come from all walks of life, they’re from different ethnic backgrounds, they’re from religious backgrounds, different age groups. There hasn’t been one specific area that I would say has been more widely accessed.  Again, like I said, we have specifically targeted, not specifically, I shouldn’t say that, we did try to target older individuals, which probably has meant we have had an older group engage with us in some capacity, but that’s because of the additional work we put in rather than saying it’s been accessed by X group. 
Int:	Just thinking back then to when it was the very start of the lockdowns and everything was happening, it sounds like you put a lot in place relatively quickly to get all that going, but what were the kinds of conversations that were happening on your organisation’s side of it about how this might go, the pros and cons, what might happen, what were you thinking of?
R:	Please don’t quote me on this, I know it’s being recorded but a lot of the processes, I find as a [work title], not disappeared  but things became easier because there was a need to get things established fairly quickly. And like I said earlier, I didn’t get repurposed as such but I went to drop off some laptops to a building and the next thing I know, the next eight weeks I’m talking about food and distributing to like X households per day sort of thing. Things just happened in that nature, teams did react quickly, and I think the organisation was very proactive in terms of setting things up. And I’m not trying to blow my own trumpet but we set up our [name of project] page, some making for donations, we were contacting everybody who was shielding, we had loads of staff just calling everybody, we had our food distribution stuff set up. Of course, the more digital support that we were providing took a little bit longer to set up because it was priority by priority, but I do think it was a very quick turnaround from [the end of] March to [the beginning of April], so much had been done in such a short span of time. And it was just people, I think a lot of people were pitching in rather than, we had a lot of people disappear at the same time, and think, I get to work from home for god knows how long, but at the same time there was a real kind of togetherness as well.
Int:	And so, there was the bits that you were trying technology wise, and was there anything you were trying that wasn’t working or that you started to roll out or you thought about trying that didn’t work so well or you didn’t see the benefit?
R:	We did a load of, I don’t want to describe it as digital training but we did a lot of online kind of training sessions, and what we found was the attendance on those was not very good to be honest, because again, it’s our demographic and our individuals and our support services are traditionally for individuals who can’t access digital equipment, so replicating it, it just meant that people weren’t attending as regularly. But fortunately, because we were an essential service, we came out of that fairly quickly, from like last August we were able to return to some sort of face-to-face delivery. But that is the one thing that I would say, is our digital attendance sessions for our kind of publicised services just weren’t great. And there’s still, to an extent, certain elements of our digital support services, digital services or courses aren’t well attended now, because again, it’s easy for something else to come up, it’s easy for you not to join an online session, whereas if you’re face to face there’s that, I don’t want to describe it as professionalism but more of a courteous effort to attend a session, essentially. 
Int:	That’s interesting to bring up. So, do you think then when there was the rolling out of digital stuff to combat the issues that have been created, but then it almost creates a vicious circle, would you say, of that then people wouldn’t engage?
R:	Yeah, and it’s an absolute irony because, like I said, we traditionally do support people who are digitally excluded. The only way we could publicise information was digitally. The only way we could engage people was over the phone or via Teams, stuff like that. It was an irony, it was one that we couldn’t get around but we had to try and be proactive in some capacity as well, so we were trying to different things, again when we could we were trying to book rooms and use facilities that we have access to in our hubs so we could have the social distancing and a customer would be on a laptop in one room and so we had ordered the Chrome Books and a member of staff would be in another room so they could provide the service that way. So, they were at least in the same building, that they could have that kind of communication, but again, we had to ensure we were keeping staff and customers safe as well, so that would be more in the case of, I don’t want to describe it as an emergency, but something that required that sort of appointment. But yeah, it was a cycle. And I still laugh about it now because pretty much all we’d do is promote stuff digitally. We’re doing [inaudible 15:31] radio ads, but the traditional footfall that we used to access in our community facilities had disappeared tenfold, so we still have to try and do something, but I know we’re not going to reach our key demographic. 
Int:	So, the people that you did feel were engaged and they did take up things and they did come along to things or log on however it looked, what do you think that was about for them? What made it easier for them or what made it more likely they would join in? Who were those people?
R:	Not a plethora of reasons but some people who were a little bit more active, some people who were a bit frustrated by the pandemic and wanted to reengage with the community groups. People who were socially isolated and who were cut off were accessing our provision as well. And then again it was just a lot of people who were just ready to get back out there. And again, I still think that of course Covid hasn’t gone anywhere, with Omicron and that version, it was people who felt a little bit comfortable engaging rather than people, I’m trying to watch my words here who say people who felt a little bit more comfortable living with Covid, because it’s not that as such, but people who were ready to reengage in some capacity because they were either challenged mental health, they were ready, they were physically prohibited from going out and they needed to do something, people who were actively seeking in the job market and wanted to take opportunities that were available at that time or still are at this time were the kind of individuals who were engaging with us, essentially. We weren’t having anyone really mandated, we don’t have anyone mandated to us, we’re not a mandatory service in any way, but we do have a lot of referrals from [name organisation] and other organisations as well, but none of that was really happening so people who were engaging with us wanted to engage with us. But yeah, they were the main reasons, that readiness to get reengaged in some capacity. 
Int:	And so, you mentioned about some of the support needing to be provided with the technology side of it, so what kinds of things were things that went wrong or things that you needed to, because I know that’s something that places have, it’s all very well putting the service in place, but then you also need something to kind of, what happens when it goes wrong, what happens when it breaks, and all of that. 
R:	Yeah, and that was the kind of thing that we did discuss. So, even though we were awarding it, we couldn’t arrange a tablet loan scheme with all of our [technology] infrastructure that we’ve got in place, which is why we went for the tablet gifting scheme and we did put the onus on the customer where there was an agreement that they would sign that if anything did happen in the case that it would be their responsibility. We would try and support where possible, but it was an agreement that the customer would have to sign alongside us if anything did happen. 
	Like I said, one of the other key issues was that data access after a certain period of time, which was I think one in four, one in five customers would return to us in some capacity just to have that conversation. We have had a couple of tablets, not as many as I thought, but there have ben a few that have been damaged. We did also have our adult learning team are successful in terms of a laptop loan scheme and our Welsh government supported our communities for work teams with a laptop loan scheme as well. There have been some difficulties there trying to get some laptops back in some capacity as well, so they’re the kind of difficulties that we have faced really. 
Int:	And especially when things are happening at scale and in a hurry as well, it’s tricky. 
R:	Yeah, but they were expected challenges as well. We knew that we weren’t going to get 100% of our laptops back. We knew 100% of the tablets weren’t going to remain fit for purpose for god knows how long sort of stuff as well. But it doesn’t make it any easier when those conversations are happening. 
Int:	I’m understanding from the way you’re saying it that the scheme was there in place say for the tablets, and so people would hear about it and then come to you rather than, was it also something that came up as an offer maybe if they were contacted about something else and you also would offer it as an option that they may not have heard about otherwise?
R:	Yeah, yeah, so it was promoted and like I said, we were working with a lot of our partners to promote the opportunities as well. And we were calling everybody who was on the shielding list and we would again say, I wasn’t really involved in that side of stuff but I think there were three or four key questions, so there was, do you need help with any food or shopping, medication, are you socially isolated, which would then lead onto a conversation about digital equipment, so there was that raising of the awareness of the support that we can provide. 
Int:	And I just wonder in that then, it may not have been yourself that was having those conversations, but if that was being offered and suggested to use technology, what some of the responses were for people who thought, oh no, that’s not for me, or what that might have been about. 
R:	At that time I wasn’t really involved. I could tell you a little bit about the conversations that I traditionally have, and people are afraid here, people who haven’t used digital equipment are afraid of digital equipment because it’s a whole different ball game. It is like learning a whole new language, it is very challenging to establish those skills and people will put confidence skills [sounds like 21:07], I don’t need to use a computer, why do I need to use a computer, I’ve got this, my daughter does everything for me, my son does everything for me. And those conversations are still continuing with certain individuals but we’re trying to highlight, look, it’s taking the pressure off your daughter, it’s look at what you can do for yourself, you don’t need to go to the bank every single week while Covid is still rife. We’re trying to highlight the things that you can do digitally to ensure your own safety as well but I will also say there’s much more people wanting to develop their digital skills as well and gain an understanding of how to use a laptop tablet, this sort of thing. But even to myself, I only use a laptop for work, I have my phone, I don’t have any other digital equipment, I don’t need to use anything else, essentially, so I kind of understand it and appreciate it as well. And like I’ve used iPhone for 12 years, if you put a Samsung in my hand, I’m going to throw it back at you because I don’t know how to use it, so I appreciate the way that some customers do feel at times as well.
Int:	Yeah, and it’s interesting because we know that there’s this barrier around almost a fear of the technology and not wanting to break it, and there’s also this element of internet scams and security and that, and I think it sounds like is that something then that was coming up for people?
R:	Yeah, sorry, I should have said, that was something that was really highlighted more recently as we’ve continued to develop our services. The amount of people who are wary of online safety, so we are trying to develop courses, not accredited courses, to make people aware of how to make sure their equipment is safe, not teaching people about cookies and that sort of language but making them aware of how to put passcodes on, when to click a link and when not to click a link, making sure about how to use internet banking in a safe kind of manner as well. So, that was something that was really highlighted. Like you said, it was the fear of using digital equipment but the element of people not feeling safe doing stuff online was, I didn’t realise how large of a concern that was for people. I knew it was but I’d say it’s the second or third or fourth most reason that we have people saying why they don’t want to use digital equipment. And people think Facebook and those kind of scams and data being ripped off, quite rightly, I’m the same, I never accept any sort of recording mechanism, I try not to anyway, I’ll close the page sort of stuff. So, it is being highlighted.
Int:	And when people would say that and your staff would be saying, ‘But what about this’, and saying the benefits, does that work, can you get people on board?
R:	Yeah, so again, I don’t mean this in a disrespectful manner to any of the customers that we’re engaging with, but the concerns that they have about online safety they won’t be engaging in any kind of manner that would, the things that they’re discussing, if you know what I mean. So, we try and say, look, the more things that you need to be concerned about is putting a passcode on your tablet, so we do have those conversations with individuals. Like I said, a lot of it is brought up and led by the customer, I was in one of our buildings the other day and I was just overhearing a member of the team supporting a customer who was saying, ‘Look, I want to do my shopping online with Tesco but I don’t want to save my banking details’, but they were doing it through the internet so we downloaded the app for them, made it secure, made sure that they were aware. So, it is trying to find the alternatives is what we try and do. We haven’t got a book, we haven’t got a handbook to say, right, this is as staff what you need to do, our service is much more client led.
Int:	Yeah, that makes sense, it’s almost a balance between what the customer might be saying they’re worried about perhaps isn’t relevant for what they’re probably doing anyway, so it’s maybe trying to explain that and meet in the middle. 
R:	Yeah, 100%, and like I said, I don’t want to speak disrespectfully of the customers that we work with, but like I said, a lot of the safety issues that they may hear about would be, like I said, like clicking the emails, spam emails to hide from individuals, yeah, it’s just little stuff like that, it’s always the worst case scenario. And again, we relate to the customers, like I’ve told customers about how I’ve had my account frauded and stuff like that, and that reassuring kind of nature for individuals as well, because it can happen to anyone, even if you haven’t got a digital footprint, your information is all still online, if you’re registered to vote in some capacity as well.
Int:	Yeah, it’s the balance between the benefit, helping us, but we need to not worry too much about some things that might stop us. It’s a difficult one to manage. So, you said about some of the examples there like people being able to set things up online and do their online shopping. So, what are some of the examples of the successes that you know where people have really engaged and it’s gone well for them?
R:	A lot of community groups went online in some capacity, so that was the main thing, helping people get set up to join their friends, neighbourhoods or communication groups in some sort of manner. Like I said, I do [work within] our adult learning team as well so a lot of people to try and join and develop their skills to the same capacity as well. Our local hubs established a community inclusion team, so they were doing like virtual gardening clubs or friends and neighbour groups for language skills and development, stuff like that. We work with our friends and neighbour group in [name of city] as well. Just about really getting people engaged back in the community, through the winter, through last winter anyway more so was the highlight that I would say. But again, that was again a little bit of a focus, it was removing that socially isolated barrier, essentially. 
Int:	And so, that was mostly things that would have been running face to face but they were moved online?
R:	Yes, yeah, so again it was that helping people transition from that face to face to online kind of learning, community groups, facility, anything like that. This is a story that sticks in my mind. We had a lady who came to one of drop in facilities and she had a tablet but she didn’t really know how to use it, so she wanted to find out more. And she lives in one of the more affluent areas in [name of city] but what she was saying was every Sunday there was the church that she used to attend, that went online, but she used to come to the library, not open on a Sunday, and sit outside, just so she could connect to the Wi-Fi. She had Wi-Fi in her home, she didn’t know how to connect to it or anything like that, and there was no real support network, so it was about, like I said, it’s just a story that sticks in my mind because I think of this old lady sat outside the hub on a rainy day with her church group, which is the kind of thing that we were trying to avoid doing.
Int:	There must be so many examples when you start to really think about it. And I suppose there’s something interesting around the people who are isolated, and when you say she might have had no support network or not close by, with the pandemic that exposed that for people more than we would have maybe known about before. And so, with the digital side of things, do you know if there’s a difference there with people who have support in place, maybe they’ve got family involved who can help them set things up, but then perhaps they’re the people who are a little bit less isolated, so then versus the other people who don’t have that around them. Is that a different provision or is it …?
R:	Do you know what, it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. We’ve had a lot of people who have been supported by their family members with, individuals who have had tablets sent to them from their family, but their family don’t live in the local area, they live in like, I don’t know, 150 miles away. So, they’ve got this kit, don’t know what to do with it, so it just kind of sits there. But then we also have the individuals who are needing to apply for the kit. So, it does funnel up into the same level of support essentially as well. And of course, people who are socially isolated, again I think of traditional groups, feel like they’re irritating family members, especially if they’re dealing with daughters or sons who have young families and they’re facing their own issues. So, like I said, it does eventually come into the same kind of support mechanism, but the starting point does differ and vary, so we may need to do a little bit more with an individual who hasn’t got a tablet, but then we also need to convince this individual that its not just a tablet to sit in a store cupboard, this is all the sort of stuff that you can do with it as well.
Int:	That’s an interesting point and I think it’s something that we know, especially with older people, about feeling like a  burden or not wanting to bother people. And that again can be a risk of creating more isolation when actually there is stuff there, when there are people there that want to help. 
R:	100%, but I think humans by nature are a little bit like that, but again, yes, certainly older people with their families and that sort of stuff, it is a conversation that we’ve had on many occasions or our team has had on many occasions as well, that kind of, look, if you ever need anything, we’re here, if you ever feel a  burden. But we know it’s not the truth, well we hope it’s not the truth anyway in some capacity, but it’s not our place to have that conversation, we just reassure the support that we can provide ongoing, essentially. 
Int:	There’s also been a sense, I know when you’ve answered the survey as well, that the landline telephone or what probably on your end is mobile phone, but for the customer is a phone, it’s not technology as such in the digital moving forward that we’re thinking of, but do you find that that’s still been a big part of being able to talk to people and use the phone?
R:	Yeah, for us, I’m just trying to think of it in two different ways, in terms of engaging customers it was vital for us because it was the only way that we could engage people. But the amount of individuals who are socially isolated that are still carrying around like an [inaudible 32:03] with them, it’s just a flip phone that you can’t do anything on other than call. But at the same time, some of our customers aren’t used to being on the phone for longer than 10, 15 minutes as well, so it was trying to change the mindset about that as well. So, yeah, a phone is, for some individuals or for most of the individuals that we’re engaging with, is at the cutting edge, like an iPhone would be at the cutting edge service, or whatever type of phone that you want to access, it would be considered cutting edge in some capacity. But it was vital for us to deliver services in some capacity. 
Int:	Yeah, and I suppose then it’s trying to persuade people perhaps if they want to get a phone that can do more things but then you’re bringing in those risks again and taking it perhaps a bit more wary. 
R:	Yeah, and [through my role] we just have to be careful of who we’re promoting and what we’re promoting as well, we do have to remain fair and equal to all providers as well. So, we do just try and highlight the additional stuff that they can do with what they’re carrying around rather than saying, right, this is what you need to go and get yourself, essentially. And that was an issue we had when we were procuring tablets as well, we just had to make sure that we did that all through our procurement framework as well. 
Int:	Yeah, and there’s something there, isn’t there, around the access to hardware and how it comes about, and I guess you could have some conversations with people where the customer wants something specific but that’s not what you’ve got. 
R:	Yeah, and there were difficult conversations as well, people would say, ‘I only want this’, and we’re like, look, we can’t do that but this is an alternative as well, and then if we couldn’t do it and they were adamant, we would try and signpost to maybe another organisation that does have a little bit more flexibility in terms of what they can offer and provide.
Int:	You’ve obviously got quite a good sense of how things have gone and what’s the uptake and things, but has there been any formal evaluation going on or any feedback you’ve been gathering along the way? 
R:	We do try and gather feedback, nothing formal. We do compile stats, we do compile our service delivery, we do have exit questionnaires with individuals as well just to see how the service is going. We are obviously still concerned with the uptake of our provision, across the board, not just within our digital team, across all of our services, and where people actually are, because the numbers that we were engaging with and the numbers that we are now engaging with, it’s a dramatic decline. So, that is something that we’re always trying to evaluate, we’re trying to highlight stuff in different ways, we’re trying to think of the Covid guidelines when we are trying to promote events in some different kind of way, we are trying to do other stuff essentially in some sort of capacity, but it is a challenge, it is a challenge that we are trying to do and that comes from the evaluation. We do more informally, I look at our data rather than saying, ‘Right, Mrs. X has said this is what would be great, and then 15 other people have done so, so we haven’t quite reached that stage but I’m hoping that once we come out of this we’ll be able to look at stuff a little bit more formally. I think our digital department as such, and our housing community service is looking at producing something in the near future, I did have to provide some information to them, but I’m not too heavily involved in that. And that will be a little bit more focused around the infrastructure, around Wi-Fi connections rather than essentially front services. 
Int:	I’m interested in decline then that you’ve had in uptake of the service generally. What is that about, is it just from the physical restrictions that have just led into then people dropping away from it, or is there something else going on?
R:	Do you know what, it’s the million dollar question. And it is a challenge, like I said, our promotion is an issue and how we can promote, that is our biggest barrier. I do think people are still, quite rightly, afraid of Covid and accessing face to face services, unless it’s an essential delivery need. And again, services, like we’ve tried to adapt to what customers would like, and we are supporting customers who want the services that we deliver, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re delivering the right services to the customers, because they’re not engaging in the numbers that they used to. But how we gather than intel again is still a problem. We did do a digital deprivation survey right back in June, but again, we could only promote virtually, we could only do it through the people that were engaged with our services, so it’s hard to quantify what that problem is. But like I say, it’s not just a problem that our digital team is facing, our employability teams are facing it, our community hubs the footfall has dropped off tremendously, it’s just we are trying things but we’re not finding the right solutions at the moment. Maybe this is the new world, we don’t know yet, so yeah, but again like I say, I would say it’s our promotion and the fact that Covid is still rife are probably the main two reasons. 
Int:	I know and I guess we can be aware of who might be lonely and who might be isolated, but it creates this issue of getting to them, and I think it feels like with the progress that’s been made with Covid then like now it almost goes backwards again and forwards and backwards and yeah, it’s not surprising people don’t know what to do.
R:	Exactly, that’s right, and that is another problem, not a problem but again there is so much kind of, not mixed messaging but people don’t know what to do. I came into work yesterday, I was like, well that announcement on Sunday was predominantly England, does that change, like I’ve got a face to face delivery running across our teams, what does that mean? And then you’re expecting staff to kind of, yeah it is, it’s all up in the air, and that’s for people who are essential, like staff who are coming in are asking the questions, let alone somebody who doesn’t need to potentially access the service that day, not saying that they won’t need to or they don’t need to engage, they don’t want to engage digitally, but there is that, they do have that barrier of maybe waiting a week, maybe waiting a month until the communication does change in some capacity.
Int:	Going forward then, it sounds like you’ve obviously picked up the face to face again recently, but now maybe we’re not sure. So, how do you see things going forward with the balance of face to face and digital provision?
R:	It will vary. For our adult learning team we will continue like more blended learning in some capacity. Our digital team will return 99% will be face to face delivery because digital engagement for people digitally excluded doesn’t work. But then our employability teams, our volunteering teams, again there will be that flexibility of having that kind of support mechanism in some kind of way. Again, it’s still better to meet people face to face, but it’s highlighted that we don’t need to meet everybody face to face, solutions can be provided and in a much quicker manner in some capacity.
	So, it will vary but predominantly we will return to more face-to-face delivery rather than digital because it’s just the nature of our client group. 
Int:	Yeah, you don’t want to exclude anybody more by having the option. 
R:	Yeah. 
Int:	That makes sense. Thank you, I’m pretty much coming to the end of the questions now but as you said, you’ve not been involved in a more formal evaluation so far and you said there’s some other teams probably doing that and you’ll look to do that in the future maybe a bit more, is there anything that you would be specifically looking for or anything that you would specifically want to evaluate with the service users or with the customers?
R:	It would be the impact that our service had on them, and that would be the key question. But then it would also focus on whether or not when they started engaging with us, if the service met their needs or if they engaged with us for a different kind of reason initially. They would be the key main reasons, and then obviously what would you like to see us deliver moving forwards would be the three areas. It would be more about that delivery of services for our front facing teams, essentially, is the sort of areas I’d look at really.
[Information removed for confidentiality]
Int:	No, it will be great, thank you. Was there anything else you wanted to share, any experiences or any other comments?
R:	No, that was all really. Yeah, I think I covered everything that we could think of. Nothing really left outstanding from my point of view anyway.
Int:	That’s great, thank you, you’ve been so helpful, it’s been really, really interesting to talk to you, some really interesting points there, definitely. Thank you for taking the time as well.

Recording Details:		P003












Int:	So if you just give me a brief overview of your role and the organisation that you work for and what you do.
R:	Okay, well I work for [name of organisation], and my role is the [job title] for older people.  So there aren't as many of us.  When strategy for older people was launched in 2003 by Welsh Government, attached to that strategy there was funding to have [job title] for older people working in each local authority area.  As time has gone by, some of the roles have disappeared and amalgamated into other roles.  [sentence removed for confidentiality].
	So my role basically is looking at implementing the local strategy for older people in line with the national strategy.  Anything and everything really that pertains to older people does come past me in terms of working with statutory colleagues, third sector, certainly third sector, certainly during the pandemic recently now, and working closely with community sectors and community groups as well.  
	So at the moment we’re signed up now to a commitment to work towards the age friendly communities definition by the World Health Organisation, so we’re working towards having that status.  So we’re engaging with communities at the moment to identify a baseline where people identify issues in their own community, and we will be using that information to develop a strategy in the very near future.  And digital inclusion, loneliness and isolation are key priorities within the strategy for older people, and the age friendly communities definition as well.  So it fits nicely with what I do basically at the moment.
Int:	So from what you’re saying then, there was already a focus on that, and this newer initiative has come along as well which builds on that, some of the same things.
R:	Yeah.  I think the work that we did previously with the communities, we’ve got a project, it’s known, well it’s termed as a place shaping project, so it’s basically engaging with communities, identifying their priorities, what they would like to see their community look like in the next five, 10 years, looking at community assets that are important for them, like community hubs, buildings, whatever, and asking individuals, what skills have you got that you can promote within your community?  So we’re looking at setting up community alliances where they’ve identified their community vision, and we’re working with them.
	So we had good network, good contact with groups already in place, and when the pandemic hit, so basically we had loads of people put their hands up to volunteer and to be part of existing support groups that we already had in place.  So yeah, the pandemic has moved some things forward really, and digital inclusion is certainly one of them.
Int:	That’s interesting and we’ll come on to that in a bit more, but I’m just, when you were talking about the initiatives, you mentioned about loneliness and social isolation being part of the priorities within that.  Can you just tell me a bit more about in the general sense how loneliness and social isolation is prioritised, how it’s focused on in what you do?
R:	Yeah.  Well, what we did a few years ago, we’ve established a social prescribing service on [name of city], and we’ve got a community single point of access.  So it’s a telephone number that individuals can contact and it’s based within our CVC, within [name of city] Community Volunteer Council, and it’s a dedicated number so individuals can call to see what’s happening in their local area, what activities, contacts and whatever.  And likewise professional staff can phone in as well so that they can help their clients in having improved contact with their community, linking people together.  
	So, for instance, if somebody is identified as lonely and isolated, they are supported in different ways, through volunteers, one to one befriending, links into community groups, community centres, community hubs, and to support us with that project we’ve recruited four local asset coordinators.  So basically they’re community connectors really. Again, funded through our integrated care funding and hosted by the third sector.  And they basically connect people in the community.  
	So you can get a social worker who identifies somebody who’s lonely and isolated.  They’ll make an onward referral to the local asset coordinator who will have that just general discussion with the individual, no more than that, it’s nothing formal whatever, and then find out what their interests are and make that link within the community, be it something one to one, be it group work, be it community hub or whatever.  
	So that’s how we tackled it, social prescribing, and linking that as well to GP practices to primary care.  So we’ve got software called Elemental, so it’s software that follows the journey of an individual from an initial referral onto whatever the outcome for that individual has been agreed.  And GPs can refer direct into a social prescribing model as well, so that's another strand to our loneliness and isolation strategy.
Int:	So it sounds like you’ve got this base of lots of different options and then a couple of main ways into it that then once people are in, they can access all the various things that might suit them.
	And you mentioned about the pandemic just before, so thinking back to the early days of the pandemic and that first lockdown, what kinds of conversations were happening around your organisation and in your role about how technology might need to be being used to help people with any loneliness or isolation?
R:	Well when we went into lockdown we established, it was a quite high level group really, chaired by the lead of the council, and the deputy chief executive, and director of Housing, and director of Social Services.  I was part of that group with the executive of the CVC [inaudible 08:47] who coordinates all the third sector and community sector, so our activities.
	So we set up a group and met regularly, I think every week initially to be honest, and digital inclusion wasn’t included initially.  It was really looking at how we can support vulnerable people within the community, so how can we support the existing networks that we have in the community expand on their role and remit, and possibly recruit more volunteers so that we could support the more vulnerable people in the community at that stage.
	Digital inclusion then became something that we discussed further as funding was made available.  So funding was made available by Welsh government, because we could change our [name of funding], anything that supports individuals throughout the lockdown.  And that’s how we were able to purchase Samsung tablets.  We were as well able to access regional funding, so we were able to access regional funding to purchase tablets, iPads, to go to our residential care homes.  So each of our residential care homes had iPads and some had more than that, more than one.
	Local asset coordinators then identified individuals who would benefit from having the tablets.  So we established a loan scheme so people could have a tablet.  The third sector then would recruit and train volunteers through [name of centre], so you could have digital companions to help individuals who were conversant with using digital equipment. 
	So we took advantage really of funding that was made available through slippages in regional projects, and we were able to pivot [name of funding] to support us with purchasing equipment, providing extra counselling services, for instance, you know, that sort of thing.  So whatever we identified where we need to strengthen our support services, we were able to utilise the [name of funding] to enable us to deliver those extra services at that time.
Int:	Okay that’s interesting.  And so you said then about identifying where the need was, and was that something that was coming purely from the pandemic and the effects of the lockdown and things like that that you were becoming aware that people needed that extra contact?
R:	Yeah, yeah, definitely.  People were obviously staying at home and you had shopping was an issue for some people.  Collecting medication was another issue.  So we were using that community network to support with, supporting individuals with those individual tasks.  And I’ve got to admit, red tape and bureaucracy went out the window and people just got down to it.  The health board came and sat down with us.  We had agreements then with data protection and whatnot in terms of supporting individuals with medication collection and delivery, and things were sorted pretty quickly to be honest with you.  I wish we could continue in that vein really. There’s a sense that we’re getting back to an element again of bureaucracy and red tape.
	But yes, so we were identifying issues as we were getting feedback from individuals and from colleagues in social work teams, and obviously people were losing that contact in the community, so there were a lot of people where, and [name of city] is a place where people do use their community assets and community venues.  So that came to a halt, didn’t it basically, overnight, so how could we maintain contact? 
	 And that’s why digital projects then became more of a focus for us to see then that we were able to connect people by the tablets, Facetime, whatever.  That became particularly important in care homes where individuals could make contact with their family, and individuals that the local asset coordinators identified who are really isolated and didn’t have that network of people around them to support them.  So again, using technology to try and alleviate some of the loneliness and the isolation there.
Int:	So you said there about the tablets and using Facetime and things, so can you just tell me a bit more about the specific devices or the specific things that popped up?  So whether that was organising, you mentioned about the community engagement, so whether there was video calls or meetings or virtual events happening.  So what kinds of things were going on?
R:	Initially we were looking at the sort of equipment, I think the focus initially for us was residential care homes.  So we had regional funding to purchase iPads, so we made sure that residential care homes who didn’t have the iPads at least had the iPads, extra care facilities, again, because of the restrictions with visiting and whatnot.  So that was our focus to begin with.
	We did hold meetings and actually managed to carry on holding virtual meetings with our older people’s council.  So we’ve got an older people’s council who take an interest in older people’s issues and co-produce services with us.  So they’re the sound piece really that I use to get older people’s voice.  So we continued with having, I think every two weeks to begin with, to be honest with you, virtual meetings with them.  So we were getting the older person’s perspective as well, because they were bringing back information from their local communities and we were discussing those issues during those virtual meetings.
	So yeah, care homes were certainly using Facetime.  Individuals within the communities were, obviously we had to recruit digital companions as well, so that took a little bit of time to train people up, but people were beginning to use Facetime a little bit more and having that contact.
	There was a project as well, [name of project], so that project is about videoing how individuals can access GP practices, for instance, you know the new arrangements.  You just cannot go in to GP practices.  But we had somebody who videoed, now this is how you go about it.  This is where you go.  Same with the shops, so we had people who went round the shops, because there were one-way systems within shops and social distancing and whatnot.  So that was a very interesting project where we put the videos online and people then could access those videos.  So just to raise that confidence level really, because -
Int:	That’s a good idea.
R:	- people’s confidence was hit wasn’t it, in terms of how safe was it to go out into shops and stuff.
Int:	Yeah, and some of those things were so bizarre, weren’t they, the masks and staying away and all of that.  So yeah, it definitely makes sense to put that in a visual.
	And so you said you had that kind of voice input from the older adults group.  What kinds of things then were coming out as some of the issues, maybe like teething problems or things that they needed more or less of?  What kinds of things were they giving you as feedback?
R:	They were saying about loneliness and isolation.  They were saying that, some people.  They were giving us practical examples of how some people were finding it very difficult to go out shopping.
	One issue was getting information to individuals, certainly people who weren’t online.  So that prompted ourselves as a council and the CVC to work on an information booklet for people, with all the relevant agencies and services, and we hand delivered, through our community networks, over 3,000 copies of those.  So we acted upon what people were telling us.  There was some misinformation or misunderstanding some of the messages that were coming from the briefings of the prime minister and the health secretary.  So there were issues around this interpreting of information and access to information. 
	So those were examples really initially of what people were telling us, and I found it very useful.  Again, people were telling us as well about the concerns about people being discharged from hospital direct back into care homes without having proper tests and stuff like that.  So we were able to feed that back as well to our services within the council.  
	Yeah, it was very useful to be honest.  They found it useful as well, because it was a two-way sort of process.  We were able to inform them what was happening as well within the council and wider with health colleagues.  So yeah, we found that to be a very useful way of engaging and continuing that engagement, because before the pandemic it was a face to face meeting.  So now we were doing it online.
Int:	Yeah, no it’s essential, isn't it, to have that.  So you mentioned about supplying the tablets and things to care homes and extra care facilities.  So how did that go?  What were some of the successes or maybe some of the problems with that being used by people?  Were there any people who did particularly well using it, or people who found it difficult?
R:	Generally I think people found it very useful to be useful, to be honest, because in care homes you’ve got a care staff who are conversant with using iPads and whatever.  The majority of the care homes did have their own Wi-Fi, so connectivity was okay.  
	Some individuals within the community didn’t have Wi-Fi, so as part of the funding we were able to get these MiFis, these, I don’t understand the technical term.  Basically you find the 4G don’t you, and you’re able then to link that into your tablet.  So we purchased a number of them as well.  We purchased some Echo Dots and Echo Smarts as well to support some individuals.
	But generally I think it went pretty well, because care homes were used to the technology to a degree.  We just increased the number of tablets that were available for residents.
Int:	And so the people then, like you say, then more in the community, there were just individuals doing it, what were some of the challenges there then of maybe supplying that?
R:	Yeah, well getting the tablets to them was something, so obviously our staff within the council delivered the tablet, and they could only deliver it and leave it at the door, couldn’t you?  You couldn't show any instruction.  We had a simple checklist that we could help individuals.  We were able to have the [name of centre] to provide that tuition to a degree to individuals who had no idea how to use the tablet, and as time went on we were able to recruit digital companions who then we were able to match individuals with individuals who were receiving a tablet.  
	And that's still ongoing and it is a challenge to recruit volunteers and to train.  We’ve got another project at the moment.  It’s the [name of online project].  Again using [name of funding] we were able to pivot some of that funding to buy some more tablets, and that project is specifically to try and get people to register on the [project app] so that we can improve the communication between individuals and their GP practice, and people were able to order their repeat prescriptions online, so trying to increase the number of people using the [name of online project].
	And part of that project is still ongoing, is still recruiting volunteers to help people.  So we’re able to coordinate and share some volunteers around another project that we have as well, which is the [name of virtual project].  So basically it’s around a website that we’ve designed with [accent 25:07], so you have your website, [name of website] with activities, with videos that are already in place for gentle exercise, whatever, and we’re hoping then that we’re able to, as people become more confident in going to community hubs, and they certainly are able to livestream some sections that happen in community hubs, for individuals who are unable to attend physically or they’re carers or whatever.  And again, they’ve got volunteers as well to help.  So we’re trying to pool all the volunteers, share the resource really, rather than working in isolation.
Int:	Yeah, because it all sort of links up, doesn’t it, in different ways.  And I suppose then you mentioned about people, different kinds of people, some who were going out more and some who were maybe still staying home and those types of things, less able to come out.  	
	So when the technology was being suggested or people were identified as perhaps being in need of that technology, what groups of people were more engaging and what groups of people maybe were less likely to engage?  Do you know if there was a difference?
R:	Yeah, definitely.  The older adults were certainly less interested in digital inclusion.  So certainly I’d say over 80s were less confident.  But having said that, we’ve got individuals over 80, well in their 90s, who are happy to use, but there certainly was a pattern developing there.  Younger people certainly were more conversant with technology.  People with learning disabilities as well were happy to use the technology.  
	So the groupings were suddenly the older adults finding it more of a challenge, and that’s why it was important for us to have those hard copies of information out to people’s homes, certainly those identified by our community connectors as people were not confident in using technology to be honest.
Int:	Yeah, so do you think it’s mostly that confidence then?  What do you think is around that?  We know that there’s this issue of some people having a fear of technology, not wanting to break things and not wanting to be affected by scams and things like that.  What do you think it’s about for them?
R:	I think it’s a combination of factors, isn't it?  You mentioned scams and not trusting the equipment, understanding how to use it, although if you break it down into a process, it’s not difficult.  But I think as well, trying not to be ageist here or whatever really, people don’t want change, ie this is something that we used to do, we communicate with people.  Digital technology in a digital world does not interest some people.
	But generally I think certainly the older adults, the 80, 85 plus, certainly more of a challenge.  But what you do there obviously is work closely with their family members there.  And again if individuals haven't got that network around them, our community connectors are very good in terms of providing that support, but mainly if they don’t want to go down the digital route, it’s basically connecting people into their community and community support networks.
Int:	Yeah, because it’s interesting you say that, because it does bring up this issue that there’s people who maybe if they are reluctant but they have quite a strong network in place, so in a way they are perhaps less isolated by having family and friends involved, and that kind of thing, versus the people who perhaps don’t have that family network setup, who perhaps need it more but it’s harder to get it in, isn't it?
R:	Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, definitely, and we do see as well on [name of city], it’s a lovely place to live.  People have come here to holiday over the years and they retire, they lose a partner, and they haven't got that community sort of connectivity as much or certainly don’t have their family members living around them.  So we have got pockets of areas where you do find individuals who are more lonely than others, certainly people who’ve moved here to retire and have possibly lost a partner and then don’t have that family network around them.
Int:	Yeah that’s interesting, so something that’s specifically to do with the geographical area that you’re dealing with is a characteristic of that.
R:	Yeah.  Yeah certainly I’m looking at the map here on [name of city] and I can tell you exactly where those individuals who would be more lonely because of exactly what I’ve just mentioned to you now, there are pockets of areas where those individuals live.  And again we know that.  Our partners know that.  So that is local information that we’re able to use during the pandemic as well.
Int:	And thinking about as well, what about some of the, I know you mentioned about the internet access and Wi-Fi and things, but what about, how did things go with technical problems?  Once you’d given somebody something, then how did you, did you find out when things went wrong or how that went?
R:	Yeah, yeah.  The initial sort of batch of iPads and Samsung tablets, we definitely had the support, the technical support from the [name of centre].  So we were able then, because they were part of the regional project with us, we were able then to access their support.  So if individuals were finding problems, technical problems with the iPad, whatever, they were able to support them with that.
	We had a couple of breakages.  We had a one that was stolen.  So you know, these things just happened as they did.  But we were able to support really individuals through the [name of centre].  But on the whole I think we haven't had that many issues with them to be perfectly honest with you.  We decided on the Samsung tablet because that was the most up to date tablet we could use.  It was a little bit cheaper than an iPad and they had a slightly bigger screen.  And the feedback that I’m getting, certainly from my colleagues in the third sector, we’re not having any real technical issues with that type of equipment. 
Int:	That’s good, because again that can be, like you said about the confidence for people using it, that can be a bit of a barrier, can’t it, to think that It can be a bit overwhelming or a fear of it going wrong and then not knowing what to do.  But it sounds like you’ve had good success there.
R:	Yeah on the whole I think it is.  I think it’s work in progress isn't it?  So we’ve got this loan scheme obviously and we’re supporting individuals for a period of time, for no longer than three months, then the local asset coordinators then will support that individual to either purchase a tablet themselves or find another grant or whatever, and then that tablet could go on to another individual.  So it’s work in progress and trying to build up the confidence levels of certainly older adults to become more digitally inclusive.
Int:	And so I suppose the flip side to what we were talking about earlier, but the people who, like you say there, who’ve obviously engaged with it and it’s gone well for them and they want to carry on and maybe buy their own or whatever, what are those successes around?  What is it about their situation that means it’s gone well for them do you think?
R:	I think the main success is to be able to communicate with family members who certainly don’t live close by.  The Facetime has certainly broadened people’s attitudes towards digital equipment and such like.   Certain individuals were able to use the equipment to have online shopping, for instance, and that’s been a godsend for some individuals as well.  So online shopping, although possibly difficult to navigate initially, people are getting a bit more used to that now and it’s made life a lot easier in terms of getting their weekly or monthly shopping.  So [overtalking 35:24] -
Int:	Yeah, yeah.
R:	- certain things there that helped people to change their minds about using digital technology.
Int:	Yeah and is there anything there that I suppose if it’s been, when the services have given one or commissioned it and thinking that it mainly was for the loneliness and isolation and things, but is there anything unexpected that you’ve heard about, you’ve had feedback on that's clocked up that’s gone well for people?
R:	Not really, nothing that’s unexpected that’s come back.  I think it’s the usual thing like, you know, the connecting with family members was paramount to some individuals, there's no doubt about it.  The GP consultation will be a key factor I think in the future, certainly because now there’s less face to face consultations.  There’s more telephone consultations and there will be definitely more use of digital consultations as well.  I can certainly see that happening, and the health board are developing new apps as we go along.  So I can see contact with primary care being a good hook to try and encourage more people to use digital equipment.
Int:	Yeah and so I suppose then the people that you mentioned before that are maybe not interested or maybe aren't wanting to engage with those kinds of things, what do you think can be done to help engage them?
R:	Yeah it is a challenge, that, I’ve got to admit.  Again I put a lot of emphasis on our community connectors, because they are out in the community.  They know these individuals, and again without sounding, hoping I’m not repeating myself, it’s possibly identifying or helping that individual to identify a community sort of network that can help them.  If they don’t want to use digital equipment, well that’s it, isn't it?  As long as there’s that sort of support mechanism around an individual, be it family members or be it community members; I think that’s what we can do there.
	Again, family members, possibly we could work closely with family members to try and support the individual, their grandparents or whatever, and possibly look at equipment that is really user friendly, that is as simple as possible to operate, have an icon on the screen where you just basically press and it opens up.  That sort of thing I should imagine, looking at equipment, making it very user friendly for the older generation to use.
Int:	Yeah, so seeing if there’s something even a bit more specific that could meet that need.
R:	Yeah.
Int:	And so it sounds like it’s really embedded in the work that you’ve been doing now, this kind of technology, and it perhaps wasn’t, it was there a little bit before but definitely with the pandemic it’s been used more would you say?
R:	Yeah.  There’s no doubt it’s progressed the agenda pretty quickly to be honest, and we’re looking at, in the future now, we have funding to have small screens and integrated sound systems put into some of our community hubs, so we can see hybrid meetings being the new norm in the future, so rather than just having these sessions within community hubs we can stream these sessions and hold hybrid meetings.  I certainly will do that in terms of our older people’s forum meetings rather than having 60 or 70 people that turn up to a local centre in [name of city] here.  I can see four or five individuals going to different hubs, and then we get together and we can have that engagement via that hybrid model.
Int:	Yeah that was really interesting you said it, because that was going to be my next question about how you see things going on in the future, because that’s one of the things that’s interesting, that a lot of places it might be that there was a sense of moving that way, but like you say, this has really sort of sped things up, because we had to.  
So then yeah, it’s interesting to think about how it might look in the future.  And if there’s a blend, like you say, maybe of some face to face and some remote, do you see there being particular areas that might need a bit of work?  I know we’ve spoken about the older adults perhaps needing a little bit more support, but do you think there’ll be, what will the levels of engagement be like across with some of the other individuals in the community?
R:	Yeah, yeah.  I think it will support our intergenerational sort of practices, certainly having that hybrid model will certainly help us to be able to engage with a wider number of individuals. It’ll help carers as well, paid carers who possibly cannot attend sessions because of their caring responsibility, or can’t attend as frequently as what they would like.  So I can see there being closer working with carers’ groups, and we’re able then possibly to engage with more carers and paid carers.  
	Certainly we’ve bought equipment as well to support people living with dementia.  So we’ve bought interactive screens for our care homes’ day services and I can see there’ll be more use of that sort of technology to provide a more dedicated service for people living with different levels of dementia.  The older adults, there are more people who are more conversant with using digital technology.  So as we go along there’ll be less people who are less confident in using the technology.  It’s what we do now to support those individuals at this moment in time who don’t want to use it for some reason or whatever.  It’s trying to support them really.
	But yeah, going forward, certainly in the council, for instance now, we don’t have to have regional meetings where we travel.  We don’t have to have national meetings where we traipse all the way from [name of city] to [name of other city] or a couple of hours’ meeting.  So it’s made life easier for us as well in one way.  It’s made it more challenging in another way, because you could go from one meeting to another.  So there are pros and cons with everything.
Int:	Yeah definitely.  And so you mentioned that you have, from like feedback that you’ve been getting and from people that you’ve spoken to from the different sectors that you’re dealing with.  Do you plan to have a kind of formal evaluation of how loneliness and isolation has been affected or might be being improved going forward?
R:	Yeah.  Probably there won't be a formal evaluation unless there’s something that is coordinated by Welsh government.  I can’t see a local, we haven't got the capacity to do it.  If we asked [name of university] to do work, probably that would cost us again whatever the cost.  I can’t see us doing a formal evaluation.  Obviously there’ll be informal evaluation of feedback that we get from individuals and community groups and third sector partners and our partners.
Int:	And it sounds like you’re getting a lot from that anyway in terms of feedback.
R:	Yeah I think so.  That’s the way, I think as time has gone by, I’ve been doing this job for a number of years, I think we’ve got these networks now that we’re able to work with and co-produce, I think it’s important that we co-produce whatever strategies that we have going forward, be it digital inclusion or be it loneliness and isolation, whatever.  I think that’s the way forward certainly, and the pandemic has moved that agenda forward as well to some degree.
Int:	Yeah, no that makes sense.  That definitely makes sense.  Well that’s pretty much all my questions.  Thank you so much for all your help.  You’ve given lots of great information there. [information removed for confidentiality].

Int:	And the organisation that you work for.
R:	Well I am the [name of title and organisation], which has now been running for seven years supported by [name of group] which is a charity group that are linked with supported housing and domestic abuse initially.  My role has been to promote and support the development of [name of organisation] across Wales obviously with [certain part of] Wales being my patch.  We started in 2014 with a team of four, and then added another development officer for [another part of] Wales because basically of the size of population.  And then temporarily for the last three years via [name of grant] we’ve had two what we call wellbeing advocates to try and support some of the guys that we work with.  
	And basically we’re following what was initiated in [name of country] about 20 years ago.  The idea of [name of organisation] being a place where originally older guys who were perhaps retired or redundant or with time on their hands wanted to get together.  Maybe work on projects, maybe just get the social aspects of it after not really dealing with missing the camaraderie of work or what have you, or just having the time on their hands.  Or through bereavement obviously as well.  So that’s how we started.
Int:	Great, that’s really interesting, thank you.  That was a great overview of everything.  So you mentioned there about the camaraderie and getting people together.  So how much focus is there on preventing loneliness and isolation specifically?
R:	They were our by-words at the beginning of this project.  It was combatting loneliness and social isolation in older men.  And we particularly picked that demographic because there wasn’t anything for older men at the time.  And also we actually were quoting that as being an epidemic that was hitting us, and this is obviously pre-COVID.  But we were really aware that there was a big issue with older men who were not dealing with isolation and loneliness very well.  Not dealing with it as well as perhaps older women, although that’s a slight generalisation.  But we targeted this group because there wasn’t really anything for them apart from going to football, playing golf, going to the pub.  And we realised that these were people who had life experiences and skills that they could share and maybe even pass on.
	And so basically using the models that we’d communicated with in [name of country] and then at the beginning of the project in [name of country], there’s a very big [name of organisation] movement in [name of country].  We realised that there was nothing in Wales.  So we started with two groups in Wales in [date], and realised that what we wanted was for every community who could would have a [name of organisation] for the guys in its community.  It did slightly morph into the fact that initially we were looking at 50/55 plus, and then basically the guys in the [subgroup of the organisation] once we were talking to groups across Wales were saying “well that doesn’t make sense, what happens if you’re 49 or whatever?”  So it became more of a generic men.  It is still mostly older men but we decided not to be exclusive.  
Int:	So you’ve got the strict criteria as such.
R:	No, they came up with “well 18 you’re supposed to be a grownup so we’ll go from there”.  And 18 means that you don’t have to worry about DBS checking in the same way.  So we went with that.  And some [subgroups of this organisation] have some young men attend and most  [subgroups of this organisation] are as you’d experience them.  
Int:	And so what’s maybe an example of an activity that might go on in one of the [name of organisation] sessions?
R:	Well there’s the traditional model which you’d expect, which is your grandfather’s father’s [place] at the end of the garden on the allotment where they tinker and do things.  That’s the first thing that people think of, is they see a lot of twinkly eyed white haired old men fixing stuff and a lot of that does go on.  There are some groups that have managed to access premises with a little workshop and they do stuff.  They fix stuff sometimes.  It’s not “oh here we are, send us all your broken stuff”.  Somebody will say “can you do this bench?”  And they’ll go “yeah, we’ll do that”.  Essentially what they will say is that [that place is for] the men.  So although we’re saddled with the word [word contains name of organisation], it is the group that has become important.  And so their days, if they’re lucky they do a couple of days a week, most just do one day a week, are basically very much about turning up, putting the kettle on, which we always say is the most important piece of kit in [this organisation].
	Kind of putting the world to rights sometimes, but also investigating different projects.  So yes we have some that have workshops.  We also have some that have basically set up community gardens and taken a vacant patch of land, and basically put planters in and grown stuff.  So every single [subgroup of this organisation] is very different.  It ideally reflects its community.  So in [a certain part of] Wales we’ve got a lot of valley [subgroup of this organisation] where there’s been a strong say mining or steelworks community.  [Another part of] Wales is slightly different because 20% of the population are very much coastal towns.  You’ve got quite a few retirees, you’ve got people who’ve come over from England.  So you’ve got a real mish mash.	
Int:	So you mentioned briefly about COVID there, and one of the things that we’re interested in then is if you think back to when that first lockdown was happening at the start of the pandemic, what sorts of conversations were being had on the organisational side of things about how technology might be needed to be used for this loneliness and isolation instead of what you would normally be doing?
R:	Exactly, this flew in the face of exactly what we’d been basically promoting.  What we promoted was get out of your house, come along to your local community centre, [name of organisation], wherever it is you’re meeting.  That was the ingredient that actually helps the wellbeing and the mental health of guys, is actually the physical conversation and being there.  Their health and wellbeing develops almost by osmosis.  In fact one of the guys in the [organisation] has basically come up with health by stealth, which is once that becomes part of their routine we’ve noticed a massive improvement in different people’s mental health, especially if they’ve suffered a bereavement and lost a wife or partner.  So when COVID restrictions came into place we were panicking to be honest.  Because my job is to go out, it’s wonderful.  
	My job is to travel round [part of] Wales, talk to groups, do presentations, support them with maybe little grant applications, dialogue with people about getting a room or some premises.  Because there is also the aspect of the [name of organisation] that they get is their den if you like.  If you go back to making dens in woods it becomes their space.  So whether it’s a wooden [place] or a container or a shop front that becomes their space.  And suddenly they’re not encouraged to go to that space.  So we as an organisation basically quickly, because I’m in [part of] Wales and the rest of my team are in [another part of] Wales.  So even before COVID meeting was always mid-way.  We’d all meet mid-way.  And obviously that’s the geography of Wales.  To travel on a train from [part of] Wales you have to go into [name of city] and down to [name of city], and driving isn’t much better.
	So we quickly adopted Zooms and Team meetings for the actual team of us so that we could probably be in touch more than we were before.  And then we basically communicated this to as many groups as we could.  We were worried because we are talking more than most about older guys.  And what was really encouraging was that independent of us because of the bonded relationships that they’d built up, some of them did set up WhatsApp groups or Facetime groups or did their own Zoom meetings.  So there was a massive breath of relief when we knew that they were keeping in touch.  It’s all very different.  So basically what’s happened over the last year is you get a core within each group that will have adopted the technology and will be happy to do this.  I’m a member of a WhatsApp group with a group on [name of city] and they use it every morning.
	Every morning it’s “morning [name]” “morning [name]”, and then a talk about the day’s doings and what’s happened and football.  And then obviously earlier this year they were allowed to physically meet so it was “are you going on Monday, I’ll give you a lift” kind of thing.  And it actually was only about a third of the actual group, but for them the WhatsApp has been a lifeline.  They’ve said this.  Other groups have done Zooms and Facetime, which has been more frustrating for a lot of them.  We as an organisation basically set up some Zoom presentations.  So via our website and via our Facebook page one of my colleagues basically took it onboard to organise every two weeks a Zoom presentation where we would get a guest speaker.
	And we would have someone talking about the history of Wales, or we had the youngest clog maker in Britain, and that was on for an hour or two and we would send out the invites.  Bearing in mind that we are accessing hundreds of guys the actual pick-up was awful.  I think the most we ever had was about 24 people.  It was a mixture of the guys don’t want to use technology.  Some of them that had smartphones, they just didn’t want to go through that process and do it on their phone, and we had the same ones turning up.  So towards the end we actually folded it, put it to sleep for a short while a few months ago because we were actually able to physically get out and start meeting.  So it’s dormant at the moment.  It’s a possibility of coming up and basically all the talks we have put out on our Facebook so people can access it if they want.
	But what we really noticed is that we were hitting maybe 20% of our guys, and we were beginning to talk to [a digitally focused organisation].  We were funded for the first six years by [name of funder] and now we have a different funding group.  So we did talk about “should we try and get a big [subgroup of the organisation] load of tablets and train the guys on how to do it?”  But it became apparent that they just didn’t want to.  So we weathered the storm of last year, we kept our profile, and what we did was we did an online newsletter that we could email to people.  And then we also got a hard copy.  So as soon as possible I went out and delivered a load of hard copy newsletters to maybe the [subgroup of organisation] leader or the main point of contact.  Some of the more able leaders would download it and print it off for their people.
	But the same as a national group some of the guys say in your local [subgroup of the organisation] would say “look, I’m only talking to half a dozen guys, I will phone every single one of them or I will get phone calls every week from them”.  “And even though we’ll have a Zoom not all of them want to do that”.  Whether that is a generational thing I’m not sure.  Having done a load of Zooms, a load of Teams meetings and even these Streamyard things I find it quite stressful.  All the jokes about your microphone’s not on or we can’t see you or your connection, I find that just an added stress.  And as the demographic I work with, there’s always some guys who are quite old but have embraced the technology really well.  And we were getting to the point where we were about to think “right, we need to do this with [name of a digital-specific organisation]”.  We’d talked to the north and south.  And then they relaxed the restrictions and that was when the guys just started to want to get back together.  Even if they were just meeting in a park they would do that.  
Int:	So it sounds like, and correct me I’m wrong, so there was a mix in that COVID, that initial time that you were aware that maybe things might need to be done, and that things might need to be put in place to support the groups.  But there was this sense of a lot of spontaneous stuff happening within the groups themselves and they were maintaining themselves by their own communications, is that right?
R:	That’s right.  Because I was involved in setting a lot of them up, I have this fatherly sense of responsibility and I worry about them.  And I’m thinking “how are these guys who are in isolated areas going to cope?”  And then when they just got in touch and went “it’s okay, we’ve got a little WhatsApp group” or “we’re doing a Facetime on Thursday if you can join us”.  There was a massive sense of relief because we could see the work we’d done over six years disappearing.  We could see all that going to pot.  It’s a crucial community based thing that was valuable and we could see “we’re going to lose a lot of these groups”.  Because for us it’s what we do as a job we thought “well these guys are only doing this one or two days a week, are they going to continue it?”  And the fact that I would say 90% of them have in some form, they’ve taken on that mantle of “we’re going to look out for our guys”.
	And so the WhatsApp has been amazing really, I think has been probably the best for those people with the right phones.  Emails obviously for those people that do their emails, although we are learning that a lot of guys only check their emails once a week.  Because a lot of them are retired so it’s a different focus.  So we were scared that they would hunker down over the lockdown.  We have had some guys who’ve not turned up and not gone back to their local [subgroup of the organisation], but generally the majority of them have and they’re keen to resume.  So they’re positive about it.
Int:	And do you have a sense, the ones that perhaps did drop away from it or didn’t stay engaged, do you have a sense of maybe what kinds of people they were?
R:	Well I think some of the most isolated ones with that.  So we have some chaps where their involvement with their [subgroup of the organisation] has been a massive benefit because they’ve been bereaved and because they’re on their own.  So we have had incidents of guys perhaps ending up drinking too much.  This is obviously pre-COVID when we were doing the [subgroup of the organisation], and just struggling.  And then when they’ve been involved in their group that has been a lifeline to them because it’s actually the people they talk to.  If you’re only talking to the postman occasionally, and this was the case before COVID that we had people who would only go to the shops once, talk to the postman and they were sitting at home and their television was their best friend.  We were dealing with that six years ago, seven years ago.
	So my fear was that this pandemic and the restrictions were really going to turn a lot of people off.  The ones that have struggled have some level of vulnerability as well.  So it’s those that are really isolated, absolutely on their own, but also those that have got maybe an underlying health issue or a partner has, and they’ve shielded and they’ve got used to shielding.  
Int:	So it’s perhaps even almost a bit of a vicious circle I suppose in the ones that are perhaps the most isolated have then found it more difficult for those reasons to actually engage and keep that going.  And so in terms of the technology side of it, I know you’ve said the WhatsApp is probably the main thing, but are you aware of any other things that have been trialled that didn’t work or there was any issues with in terms of the technology itself or the devices, anything like that?
R:	I think as I said the Zoom things were really frustrating because you have to take a code.  You get the code, you get your link, you miss one digit or one lower case.  These guys just want to switch something on and it happens.  Because when you make a phone call you put the number in and you speak to the person.  And I think both myself and my admin colleague did your questionnaire, and we phoned each other up afterwards and he said to me “so the last bit about which technology worked best for us, what did you say?”  And I went “the phone”.  And he went “yeah, I said that”.  I’ve got daughters who are Twittering and doing everything all the time, and they’ve probably got a USB port on top of their arm somewhere.  But the older people, they want to talk to people.  
	So it’s really easy to talk on the phone because you’re focusing on the voice and the conversation.  We’ve noticed when they were doing the Zooms they were really nervous because they could see themselves, they weren’t quite happy to then mute or blank themselves because they thought it was rude.  So they’re not going to go “look, there’s my name but you can’t see me” because they thought that was a rude thing to do.  At the same time they weren’t happy with “well you need this certain light, and you need to sit here, and you need to get the camera on your laptop or on your computer facing this, and if you can plug in your headphones”.  They were like “I just want to talk to somebody”.  That’s where our wellbeing advocates have basically over the last few months changed their workload so that they actually basically do phone befriending.
	So they’ve worked with various organisations North and South Wales particularly to do with older people.  And basically through the [name of organisation] they’ve basically picked up the slack with older men.  And they’ve found out that those conversations that they’re having every week are a lifeline for a lot of these guys to talk about.  Irrespective of whether they’re having an issue with their housing or stuff.  And I’ve also noticed that this year particularly emails, people are a lot tardier in answering emails.  You’re almost staring at your screen going “did those get sent?”  “I need to check whether I sent those”.  “Why haven’t all of those 20 people that I’ve just emailed responded?”  And you realise that people are being selective.  That comes into the technology side.  They’ll do a tier system.  I was talking to one chap who lives quite isolated and his television is on straightaway in the morning.  He has got a laptop so that’s fine, and then it’s a phone call.  He doesn’t want anything else.  
Int:	And so I suppose the phone then is one that’s stayed the same throughout isn’t it?  Whereas the other bits of technology that have been brought in or are more new and using for different reasons, whereas the phone is that constant isn’t it?
R:	Yeah absolutely.  And also WhatsApp is quite good because they treat it like a text.  I WhatsApp my colleague and we talk using the phone with a camera.  These guys don’t use their cameras, they just use the WhatsApp in its text format.  They’ll do that and it’s great with spelling mistakes.  Some of them just text like they speak which is wonderful.  But it’s that immediacy, I don’t know whether it’s an old blokey thing but they do do that.  The Zooms that I’ve talked to people about, you get a core of maybe half a dozen people in an organisation, in a group, who regularly meet up on Zoom.  Any more than half a dozen they really feel not comfortable.  Even though there should be more because obviously there’s more members in the [subgroup of the organisation], but most of them eventually honed it down to about half a dozen that would do it regularly.  
Int:	And do you know then I suppose the flip side of what I was asking before, but then what other perhaps characteristics or similarities of those people that do continue to do it, or are the ones that want to do it?
R:	They are a bit more confident, a bit more techy.  Tend to be ones that have - and this is going to be a broad minded answer but bear with me - engineer types, guys that are interested in the lathes and the equipment and have got experience of working in maybe larger organisations.  Because we have a demographic that most of the guys in [name of organisation] they haven’t got a big pension.  We don’t deal with a lot of people who are massively comfortably affluent.  These are guys who have worked all their lives, they’ve got their pension.  Obviously there are a few anomalies and especially with ex-service guys who’ve got their pension and their service pension.  But generally most of the guys are working guys.  And so they’ve not had to embrace loads of technology.  
	I’ve got somebody I’m thinking about who’s worked in technology, worked for aerospace.  He wears one of those iWatches that tells him his body core temperature every five minutes.  He’s got a phone that he’ll just talk into and say “let me know when this is happening”.  Him and his core are fine.  But then there are other groups where it’s that confidence, it’s that extra learning thing that they have to do.  They’ve retired so they’ve learned all the skills that they’re going to learn, which some of them are massive.  And it’s interesting because the patron of the [name of organisation] is a professor at [name of university].  And he wrote two books about the [name of organisation] movement, and the first one was called [name of book].  And that was about the fact that you turn up at a [subgroup of the organisation] that has equipment and you’ll have people that have been using that equipment all their life.  But you might have somebody that’s come from say the hotel trade and they don’t know how to.  
	So they’re sharing their skills, and within that group the guy who’s been used to working in a hotel and is good with people, he will be the guy that is having meetings and talking about funding.  Whereas you’ve got the other guys who know how all the equipment works and all the safety, and they can bash a set of shelves together.  So you’ve got a mix of experiences through their working lives, and it tends to be the guys that are more confident who’ve been probably dealing with more people, and this is a big generalisation because you’ll get individuals who are just ace.  But the ones I’ve noticed who are accessing more of the media tend to fall into that category.
Int:	That does make sense.  And so I suppose is there scope within your organisation or the representatives within each local one that they could do anything to help people to engage?
R:	We have had some people.  We got to the doorstep of that as to whether we should get a load of tablets and then go round.  And it was “should we just get a load, shall we get one for each [place]?”  We’ve gone from two [places] in [date] to nearer 70 in Wales.  Some of them fallen off obviously but it’s not really because of COVID.  And the idea was “should we get one say tablet for each [subgroup of the organisation]?”  Maybe, but then it was like “how is that going to work with the wifi, using a dongle or something?”  The good [places], established [places], some of them already have a computer there set up in a little office.  But it’s getting the old bloke who has got one of these old brick phones, a Motorola or something, and his philosophy is “I’ve got a mobile phone, it’s for emergencies if I break down because I’ve got a landline”.  “I have got a computer but I just use it for emails and doing things on Google”.  
	So there’s a bit of resistance to having a smartphone, because we have had these discussions.  “No, I don’t want one of those”.  And also the cost implications.  Now I’ve seen in the back of Sunday supplements targeted at older people simple phones with great big buttons and stuff.  Something like that.  I think it’s the fact that they have to go through so many stages to make the thing accessible.  I had a discussion with one guy who was so frustrated because he actually doesn’t even have wifi.  He has a landline, a television and he has a mobile phone and they changed his ability to top it up.  It was a pay as you go, and he was really upset because he’d got into the habit of knowing how to top it up.  You could either buy a little card or you could do it on the phone, and then the provider changed and he was going to have to go into a shop and that was awful.
	He was upset that he was going to have to go into a different shop because they’d changed the provider.  And this is his rescue phone.  You can text him and if the car breaks down kind of thing.  And so I found a massive resistance among some people.  And also the ones that really don’t want wifi, they just feel it’s another thing.  So there is a mixture and I’d say it falls probably about 80/20 against the technology.  Again that is a generalisation and that’s just from individual conversations I’ve had.  Because it’s changed, a lot of people had old computers and then laptops, and then smartphones came out.  And smartphones really throw people.  Because you’ve got that amount of power in your hand and you can do anything.  And they want things to be easier.  I know they are easier.
Int:	It’s easy when you know isn’t it, whereas when it’s new it’s different.  When you were saying there about it can do everything, is there a sense of fear there maybe?  We know that that is there for older people sometimes, that fear of the technology and internet scams, or not wanting to break something.  Is there that for these people do you think?
R:	There is that definitely.  Our wellbeing advocates are both [previous job title] actually.  They’re brilliant.  Unfortunately we don’t have them forever.  So they’ve put out a lot of information about internet scams.  As I’m talking to you I’m picturing different chaps that I know throughout [part of] Wales.  Even the WhatsApp groups will say “oh it looks like someone’s tried to scam me”.  And they are massively scared of somebody, it’s not “oh they’ve taken my savings and I’m skint”.  It’s nothing to do with that.  It’s the fact that somebody can access their bank accounts and their hard earned pensions.  And so there is a fear.  It’s a bit like having smart metres as well.  There’s a lot of resistance against having smart stuff.  So the guys that embrace technology have got cameras in their cars and on their doorbells and they’re happy to have something that opens their curtains.
	They are the minority in a huge form.  The majority of the guys, it’s too much hard work I think.  The thing is they’ll accept a mobile phone that you press the button and it pings on and you dial or text.  It’s dead simple.  Some of them will go the next step and go “oh you can take photographs with it”.  “Oh I’ve got photographs here of stuff I’ve made”.  But then the communication aspect of it.  Whenever in the past I’ve had presentations and you’ve got a room full of people eating biscuits and having coffee and you’ve done your presentation about it, and you ask questions or there’s interaction.  You’ll get some people that will not say anything.  They’re like the kids in the classroom at the back.  You’ll get the people that are confident enough to speak in a public place, and you’ll get the people that will have a question but get nervous when everybody turns round to stare at them.
	That’s what they feel about Zoom or one of those platforms where you can see everybody talking.  They get so self-conscious, because they’re used to eye to eye direct talk or as we call it in the [name of organisation] movement shoulder to shoulder.  So you actually don’t have to talk directly to someone about any issues, but you can resolve those by chatting while you’re doing something.  But if you actually look at people on a Zoom they’re very self-conscious.  There’s always the “oh the cat’s come in or this has happened”.  But it’s seeing themselves on screen.  And then realising that they can see what they’re saying and listen to themselves.  There’s a lot of self-consciousness.  Even people who are slightly more confident, if they’ve not got experiences of addressing a group of people, suddenly they’re addressing a group of people.
Int:	And it’s interesting what you were saying there.  There’s almost a sense of then that Zoom environment is almost opposite to the [name of organisation] approach in that being just more next to each other, and it’s a little bit more informal.  So being thrown into that Zoom context it sounds like that’s really contrasting with what they might be used to and what it’s about.  
R:	It is, it’s very anxiety making.  And I’m doing it, I’ve got a Zoom meeting and I’m getting a bit anxious.  I was due to do a presentation yesterday as an induction and there was a PowerPoint and here’s the link.  And I was so chuffed when it got cancelled.  And also because you’re watching yourself play with your beard or scratch your ear or your glasses have slipped or the camera has taken your gaze slightly and it’s so distracting.  Whereas if you’re talking somebody you’ve got the nuances.  And even talking on the phone you get the tone of voice, you get the pause.  And I’ve found that with a landline it’s great because you get a good solid connection, but sometimes with a mobile you’re going “no you”, “no go on, it’s okay”.  And that’s what they find about Zoom.  You get that slight delay.  
	So it’s hard.  I think if we had an ideal situation, and if we could have got funding we’d have rolled out workshops.  Well we wouldn’t, we’d have got [a digitally focused organisation} to do it because they know far better.  I think normally when we’ve pre-COVID had a presentation or a workshop the guys will go to it as part of their [subgroup of the organisation] when they wouldn’t go to it as an individual.  So that would be the key maybe, and also there is a cost implication for a lot of guys.
Int:	I suppose the thing with COVID is when it popped up it was under that blanket of the restrictions.  So that ideal situation perhaps of embedding the technology within a normal [subgroup of the organisation] situation was just not possible.  So it was too late I suppose to then just go back and do it wasn’t it?
R:	Definite hindsight thing.  If we’d have known.  But we do things in the past, things like prostate cancer awareness, triple A, which we’ve got guys to have checks on aortic aneurisms and even bowel cancer checks.  And because we can deliver it through the [name of organisation] model we can actually reach guys who won’t do it through their GP.  So that would be the slight crack in the door to future getting hold of them.  We’re going into another odd phase now.  Obviously in Wales I think most of the guys feel that they’ve been quite sensibly supported.  We still have to wear masks on public transport, in shops, they have restricted their activities many of them.  And the opening of their [subgroup of the organisation] in about May when we got the green light was a massive lifeline to many of them.
	So whether we get through to the other side of this.  It’s one of those things that you think “right okay, if we could give everybody a very basic smartphone that was really simple, that had a really simple way of accessing it”.  And especially to those guys that don’t have wifi because I suspect there’s a resistance because of their age.  It’s a bit like my grandmother who was born in the 1880s couldn’t understand electricity at all.  She thought it would come out of the sockets.  If there was a general initiative to say “right, we’re going to give every older person a really simple Dobro phone that has these things on it”.  It’s a bit like having a panic button isn’t it?  But you see the other thing is that they pick up on the idea that they’re going to lose their landlines and everything’s going to be wifi. If you’ve got a panic button and it’s not going to work like that.  They pick up on these things that are relevant to older people.  Because as you get older, trust me, you get achy and bits don’t work as well.  
Int:	So it’s weighing up what you’re comfortable with and what might be of benefit but what you’re prepared to actually explore I suppose isn’t it?
R:	Yeah, but the contrast is interesting, is how many of them have Netflix or Amazon.  So they’ll have a satellite dish.  And you’re thinking “well if you do that”.  So I think it’s always how you initiate this kind of idea.
Int:	And I suppose then because I think it asked this in the survey as well about looking forward, and you were just talking there about lessons learned and thinking about the future.  Obviously the model is face to face and that’s what it’s based on, and you had remote things that did pop up a little bit later.  But what do you see in the future in terms of is there a place for that technology side of it to continue regardless of COVID and anything like that?
R:	I think it’s another weapon in our armour.  We’ve talked about this, my team.  Essentially our goal is to get people meeting face to face because that is the positive energy.  It’s really hard when someone says “I’ve come to this meeting because I’m lonely and I don’t see anybody”.  That is a really hard thing (a) to confess to, but (b) to understand.  And what you find is that the guys understand that.  They’re not all touchy feely don’t get me wrong, there’s still that blokiness of “right, we’ll put the kettle on and do this”.  But there is a myriad of different facets to it.  When we started we said “right, we’ll do a website”.  We got a website designed, and then it was “right, we’ll do a Facebook”.  And I’m like “oh okay, Facebook, I get that”.  Then it’s Twitter, and I’m like “well I don’t do Twitter” but some of my team do Twitter.  
	And then the next thing “well we don’t do TikTok” but that could be the next thing.  And then we have a YouTube channel because a lot of other [subgroup of the organisation] in other parts of the world have that.  So YouTube is useful for learning things like how to use a piece of equipment.  So we have that to promote what we’re doing.  So for me this very quick experience of things like Microsoft Teams and Zoom and Streamyard has been really interesting.  And it’s there as another string to the bow, but it doesn’t replace the key tenants of what we do.  
Int:	That completely makes sense.  
R:	The only example is I’ve got a guy who is a fantastic wood turner, and so as well as being involved in this local group he is involved in a wood turning group.  And in that role he’s always looking on YouTube for different things to do and things to make.  But his wood turning is a bit separate to his involvement in his [name of organisation] because that’s more of a social aspect.  So he’s more than capable to see the benefits of being able to go on YouTube and learn how to do almost anything.  I think it’s a question of educating.  It’s re-learning.  Some people feel they’ve been topped up as much as they’re going to be when they’re 70, and some people have a different approach.  And I think for us it would be another string to the bow.  It’s just a question of delivery.  
Int:	Do you think there would be any plans from the organisation side of it around evaluating the use of technology or how it’s been going or what might be useful?
R:	We can’t do that, we don’t have enough team members, and we’ve actually lost a couple who’ve moved on and our funding is always fluid. So we wouldn’t have the ability.  What I’m talking to you about is as a representative of my team of four that were seven and will probably be two in the New Year actually.  The general consensus of working with [places of their organisation] across Wales, and obviously I represent from the tip of [name of city] down to about [name of other city], and then my other colleagues obviously deal with the [name of region] which is 80% of the population of Wales.  I deal with some of the more hilly bits.  And there are slight differentiations there as well because [part of] Wales, the [name of region] has three cities.  You’ve got [name of the three cities].  
	We’ve got [name of city] and kind of [name of city] and there’s a difference.  So what you’ve got in an urban area you’ve got more people on top of each other.  You’ve got a more communicable society there.  Whereas in some of the smaller towns it’s been a different role.  Nonetheless really important but slightly different because they’ve not got access to as many say support groups.  So we know that everything happens in [name of city], and because of the size of the population [in that part of Wales] you’ve got far more access to more social workers, Mind workers.  Whereas up here they’re scattered and far trickier, and also the community groups.  So it’s about getting the information out there which we tend to do via our website, Facebook and emails at the moment.  
	If we could have done a survey we really would, and that’s why myself and my colleagues joined yours because we thought it was massively important.  But we realised that this actually is a string to the bow.  It can’t replace what the chaps we work with need, but actually once they’ve realised it’s not as terrible and they could perhaps get more experience of it, it would be okay.  But I think what happened to a lot of the older guys is they got into a certain routine over lockdown that was going to shops, going to the chemist, maybe going to the GP, going for a walk.  And then this might be the one time they had a technology meeting was Zoom or Teams or stuff like that.  And so it wasn’t high on their list.  
Int:	Just on that I suppose when you were saying before about the percentage of people that did keep engaged and did keep on and did use the technology side of it.  What do you think was the motivation for those people?  I know you talked about their confidence and perhaps that more practical aspect, but what do you think was going on there in terms of motivating them?
R:	That’s easy, they were looking after their guys.  These are people that we sometimes refer to as [name of organisation] leaders.  They might be the sort of person that’s perhaps more confident in writing letters, putting in applications to [funder], dealing with emails.  So they naturally may be the chair of the [name of organisation] or the secretary.  It’s hard to explain this. The guys in the [subgroup of the organisation] care.  One of the minor things is we care but we’re not carers.  So they try and be as open as they possibly can to people joining the [name of organisation]. They welcome anybody.  It’s very rare that they turn people away.  So a lot of the [subgroup of the organisation] are run by the guys themselves.  They’re not trained in OT or any kind of social work or mental health nursing.  So they care, and they will bend over to try and accommodate somebody who maybe has mental health issues, maybe doesn’t deal very well with being with groups of people.  But they’re keen to be inclusive.  So it’s generally been somebody who’s been a hub if you like.
Int:	So a sense of the responsibility that they feel for the others, and keeping that going.  That’s really interesting.  And that there’s that role perhaps in all of the groups or a lot of the groups and someone’s got that role it seems.
R:	It’s very reflective of modern times.  We don’t claim to be rocket scientists.  We stole our concept or the concept of [name of organisation] was probably stolen from [name of organisation], which has been going for hundreds of years.  It’s just worked out as a blokey kind of thing.  But having said that we have now had a women’s group established and calling themselves [name of organisation].  And particularly in [part of] Wales there’s a group who set up something called [name of organisation].  And they’re working with a particular demographic of young people 14 to 20 something who have struggled with school.  They follow the same tenants [sic] except they probably do more fun things with scooters.  Definitely the [name of organisation] do a lot of virtual media games where they’ve got headsets and they’re communicating with a different group somewhere else.
	Our guys aren’t going to do that.  They might try it but they’re wanting a cup of tea and a Hob Nob and to have a good chat, and to maybe make a bird box or a bird table or fix a fence.  The model is basically about supporting your community on your doorstep.  People get the wrong idea of “oh it’s all men”.  It’s not at all.  Some [places] because they have a very small population don’t call themselves [name of organisation], they call themselves a Community [name of organisation] or [it] is named after the town that they’re in and it’s just [name of organisation].  And they’re there supporting isolated and vulnerable people whatever.  And so it has mutated into this support.  We did have one group on [name of city] that pre-COVID basically had the local year six children coming in to help the older guys with their tablets, and they helped them with planting vegetables and bulbs.
	That’s where you’ve got the cross generational thing.  But people go “oh it’s such a great concept”.  It’s actually what you should be doing on your doorstep really.  It’s that idea of your tribe is the people that live in your area, and the [name of organisation] aspect of it, this is just a space for men.  Some groups do it brilliantly, they have a day for men and then a day for women, and then a mixed day.  So that you know that you can do this.  Then you get a lot of the guys who have abdicated responsibility of technology to their wives.  So it’s a real mish mash and obviously because no one saw it coming in any shape or form, the technological side has still taken us by surprise.  And although we’ve seen the benefits it hasn’t worked as well as we thought.
Int:	It’s really interesting that you say the mixture of how it’s landed with different people and what the different reasons might be for that.  And interesting as well about the sense of the different areas that you cover and almost the whole project is aimed at reducing the isolation, but some of the communities are actually more isolated anyway more geographically.  So that’s another level to it isn’t it that you’re having to consider.
R:	Things like buses.  When you get older buses and people who aren’t driving.  For me the joy of my job has been the opportunity to meet communities and see there are so many examples of “if only everybody could see what you’re doing in that community”.  It’s fantastic, and you see people in their communities pulling together to support.  That’s the key.  It’s really hard if you’ve got a vibrant life, I’ve got children, dog, cats, but when you meet people who haven’t.  The isolation and loneliness we were saying is worse than smoking.  Everyone’s heard that one, but we were using that six or seven years ago.  That the effect on our mental health from isolation and loneliness is crippling.  The act of getting somebody over the threshold into a group, letting them sit at the back with a cup of tea and just absorb it, and seeing the difference.  
	The testimonies I’ve had from individuals about the effect of being involved in a particular group of [name of organisation] even if it’s a day a week on their life is greater than we anticipated.  So we were really scared when the COVID thing came because it undid all our work.  We were just grateful that some people within those little groups had the foresight to say “well I’ll show you how to do this on your phone [name], and we can do this every morning” or “I can help you set up your computer and we’ll just have a meeting”.  And even though it isn’t the be all and end all it has saved a lot of people.  
Int:	That makes sense.  We’re hoping as part of all of this to be able to talk to some older adults about their experiences as well, and I don’t know if it would be something that’s possible on your end, but we might be contacting you again separately just to see if there’s a way that there might be a possibility of helping us to recruit some people to talk to us about their experience.  No pressure today about if that’s possible or not, but if we could drop you a line about it.
R:	Absolutely, that’s easily done.  We’ve had a lot people come to talk to our [subgroup of the organisation]. There’s a group in [name of city], [name of city] Opera, who are actually doing the [name of organisation] opera.  They understand it.  So a lot of our guys are very amenable to having a chat probably on the phone, but to explain what their experiences are.  Because it’s for this movement, they might not have done it as an individual but they’re more likely to do it under the auspices of [name of organisation].  It’s one of those things that once you start doing it, it’s an odd title but we’re saddled with it.  I did have a Zoom meeting about two months ago with representatives from the [list of four organisations and countries], and a chap from [name of country] who was saying “well we haven’t got an association but we’re actually bigger than Wales”.
	So it’s a spreading movement if you like.  And for a guy in his local firstly the sense of belonging is massive.  Then the sense of camaraderie and somebody who is at the end of the phone.  But then also the fact that they can belong to the Welsh [name of organisation] or there’s a UK [name of organisation], there’s a Scottish [name of organisation].  They can tap into all the different aspects of all these different groups, and what they make or what they bake or what they cook or what they do.  So once you’ve got that sense of “well I have a feeling of belonging” that helps you deal with the other aspects of your life.  
Int:	Absolutely, it sounds brilliant and amazing for it to be so wide reaching as well, worldwide, it’s great.  
R:	I know.
Int:	So thank you so much.  That’s all of my questions.  Was there anything else you wanted to share or mention or ask?
R:	No, I meant to mention, just because we have a lot of carers, but that’s another conversation to have isn’t it?  The situation that carers have found themselves in.  So I’m just going to throw that in there that we have a lot of guys who are carers and their [subgroup of the organisation] day is their respite.  But no, if you said “what’s your wish list?”  If we could have national across the UK funding.  Everyone’s aware that all the children in schools were getting laptops and tablets and stuff.  I think they need to look at that for older people as well.  I can’t remember what the name of those phones are that you see in the back of the supplements that do everything but are really big for your little bendy fingers.  If there was the technology that could make a very simple smartphone that people could access this technology on I actually feel certain that we certainly in Wales could roll out the training.  And then in the likelihood that we get another wave of something or another pandemic, people have access to more methods of communication.  
Int:	So it’s about learning isn’t it, and then trying to be more prepared.  But you as an organisation having the support, resources, funding, etc, that goes with that to make it happen, and it’s not always possible overnight is it, and that’s actually what happened before.  
R:	Absolutely.  
Int:	And just when you mentioned then about carers, that carers population, were they people you felt that stayed more engaged over COVID or that maybe did drop away?
R:	I would say the latter.  If they were shielding.  The lack of services from social services in communities that were in place pre-COVID have still not resumed.  So the carers, and unpaid carers, have been more isolated than ever.  
Int:	And so the technology wasn’t enough or wasn’t suitable.
R:	No, again it depends on the individual but generally because of their situation the carers were really left out.  
Int:	And it’s obviously an important part of the group that you have anyway, and you can see that would be all over as well, not just even the smaller communities definitely.  Well thank you so much, you’ve given me so much information there that’s so helpful.  It’s really been interesting talking to you.  [information removed for confidentiality]
